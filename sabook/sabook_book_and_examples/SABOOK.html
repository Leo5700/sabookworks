<b>INDEX</b>
</p><p>
<b>Acknowledgments</b>
</p><p>
I am indebted to Professor George Rowlands of the University
of Warwick for introducing me to chaos and fractals
and for countless
stimulating discussions.
</p><p>
Professor Edward Pope of the University of Wisconsin - Madison
Art Department assured me that these patterns have artistic appeal
and suggested ways to display them.
</p><p>
Dr. Clifford Pickover of the IBM Watson Research Center
the
guru of computer visualization
provided encouragement and suggestions
during the early development of the ideas on which this book is
based.
</p><p>
I would also like to thank Ray Valdes for carefully reading the
manuscript and providing  numerous helpful suggestions.
</p><p>
Finally
I am grateful to scores of individuals who have critically
viewed my attractors and who collectively raised my artistic consciousness
to the point where this book could become a reality.
</p><p>
<b>Why This Book Is For You</b>
</p><p>
Art and science sometimes appear in juxtaposition
one aesthetic

the other analytical. This book bridges the two cultures. I have
written it for the artist who is willing to devote a modicum of
effort to understanding the mathematical world of the scientist
and for the scientist who often overlooks the beauty that lurks
just beneath even the simplest equations.
</p><p>
If you are neither artist nor scientist
but own a personal computer
for which you would like to find an exciting new use
this book
is also for you. Fractals generated by computer represent a new
art form that anyone can appreciate and appropriate. You don't
have to know mathematics beyond elementary algebra
and you don't
have to be an expert programmer. This book explains a simple

new technique for generating a class of fractals called <i>strange
attractors</i>. Unlike other books about fractals that teach you
to reproduce well-known patterns
this one will let you produce
your own unlimited variety of displays and musical sounds with
a single program. Almost none of the patterns you produce will
ever have been seen before.
</p><p>
To get the most out of this book
you will need a personal computer

though it need not be a fancy one. It should have a monitor capable
of displaying graphics
preferably in color. Some knowledge of
BASIC is useful
although you can just type in the listings even
if you don't understand them completely. For those of you who
are C programmers
I have provided an appendix with an equivalent
version in C. You may find the exercises in this book an enjoyable
way to hone your programming skills. As you progress through the
book
you will gradually develop a very sophisticated computer
program. Each step is relatively simple and brings exciting new
things to see and explore. Alternately
you can use the accompanying
disk immediately to begin making  your own collection of strange
attractors.
</p><p>
It is my hope that this book will instill in the artist a greater
appreciation of science and in the scientist a greater appreciation
of art
and that it will bring enjoyment and satisfaction to computer
enthusiasts
both new and seasoned.
</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 1</b>
</p><p>
<b>Order and Chaos</b>
</p><p>
This chapter lays the groundwork for everything that follows.
Nearly all the essential ideas
mathematical techniques
and programming
tools are developed here. If you master the material in this chapter

the rest of the book should be smooth sailing.
</p><p>
<b>1.1  Predictability and Uncertainty</b>
</p><p>
The essence of science is predictability. Halley's comet will
return to the vicinity of the earth in the year 2061. Not only
can astronomers predict the very minute when the next solar eclipse
will occur but also the best vantage point on the Earth from which
to view it. Scientific theories stand or fall according to whether
their predictions agree with detailed
quantitative observation.
Such successes are possible because most of the basic laws of
nature are <i>deterministic</i>
which means they allow us to
<i>determine</i> exactly what will happen next from a knowledge
the present conditions.
</p><p>
However
if nature is deterministic
there is no room for free
will. Even human behavior would be predetermined by the arrangements
of the molecules that make up our brains. Every cloud that forms
or flower that grows would be a direct and inevitable result of
processes set into motion eons ago and over which there is no
possibility for exercising control. Perfect predictability is
dull and uninteresting. Such is the philosophical dilemma that
often separates the arts from the sciences.
</p><p>
One possible resolution was advanced in the early decades of
the twentieth century when it was discovered that the quantum
mechanical laws that govern the behavior of atoms and their constituents
are apparently <i>probabilistic</i>
which means they allow us
to predict only the <i>probability</i> that something will happen.
Quantum mechanics has been extremely successful in explaining
the sub-microscopic world
but it was never fully embraced by
some
including Albert Einstein
who until his dying day insisted
that he did not believe that God plays dice with the Universe.
</p><p>
Science has since the 1970's been undergoing an intellectual
revolution that may be as significant as the development of quantum
mechanics. It is now widely understood that <i>deterministic</i>
is not the same as <i>predictable</i>. An example is the weather.
The weather is governed by the atmosphere
and the atmosphere
obeys deterministic physical laws. However
long-term weather
predictions have improved very little as a result of careful

detailed observations and the unleashing of vast computer resources.
</p><p>
The reason is that the weather exhibits extreme <i>sensitivity
to initial conditions. </i>A tiny change in today's weather (the
initial conditions) causes a larger change in tomorrow's weather
and an even larger change in the next day's weather. This sensitivity
to initial conditions has been dubbed the <i>butterfly effect</i>

since it is hypothetically possible for a butterfly flapping its
wings in Brazil to set off tornadoes in Texas. Since we can never
know the initial conditions with perfect precision
long-term
prediction is impossible
even when the physical laws are deterministic
and exactly known. It has been shown that the <i>predictability
horizon</i> in weather forecasting cannot be more than two or
three weeks.
</p><p>
Unpredictable behavior of deterministic systems has been called
<i>chaos</i>
and it has captured the imagination of the scientist
and non-scientist alike. The word "chaos" was introduced
by Tien-Yien Li and James A. Yorke in a 1975 paper entitled "Period
Three Implies Chaos."  The term "strange attractors
"
from which this book takes its title
first appeared in print
in a 1971 paper entitled "On the Nature of Turbulence
"
by David Ruelle and Floris Takens. Some people prefer the term
"chaotic attractor
" since what seemed strange when
first discovered in 1963 is now largely understood.
</p><p>
It's not hard to imagine that if a system is complicated (many
springs and wheels and so forth) and hence governed by complicated
mathematical equations
that its behavior might be complicated
and unpredictable. What has come as a surprise to most scientists
is that even very simple systems
described by simple equations

can have chaotic solutions. However
<i>everything</i> is not
chaotic. After all
we <i>can</i> make accurate predictions of
eclipses and many other things.
</p><p>
An even more curious fact is that the <i>same</i> system can
behave either predictably or chaotically
depending on small changes
in a single term of the equations that describe the system. For
this reason
chaos theory holds promise for explaining many natural
processes. A stream of water
for example
exhibits smooth (<i>laminar</i>)
flow when moving slowly
and irregular (<i>turbulent</i>) flow
when moving more rapidly. The transition between the two can be
very abrupt. If two sticks are dropped side-by-side into a stream
with laminar flow
they will stay close together
but if they
are dropped into a turbulent stream
they quickly separate.
</p><p>
Chaotic processes are not random; they follow rules
but even
simple rules can produce extreme complexity. This blend of simplicity
and unpredictability also occurs in music and art. Music consisting
of random notes or of an endless repetition of the same sequence
of notes would be either disastrously discordant or unbearably
boring. Art produced by throwing paint at a canvas from a distance
or by endlessly replicating a pattern like a piece of wallpaper
is similarly unlikely to have aesthetic appeal. Nature is full
of visual objects such as clouds and trees and mountains
as well
as sounds
like the cacophony of excited birds
that have both
structure and variety. The mathematics of chaos provides the tools
for creating and describing such objects and sounds.
</p><p>
Chaos theory reconciles our intuitive sense of free will with
the deterministic laws of nature. However
it has an even deeper
philosophical ramification. Not only do we have freedom to control
our actions
but the sensitivity to initial conditions implies
that even our smallest act can drastically alter the course of
history
for better or for worse. Like the butterfly flapping
its wings
the results of our behavior are amplified with each
day that passes
eventually producing a completely different world
than would have existed in our absence!
</p><p>
<b>1.2  Bucks and Bugs</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>Enough philosophizing--it's time to look at a specific
example. This example will require some mathematics
but the equations
are not difficult. The ideas and terminology are important for
understanding what is to follow.
</p><p>
Suppose you have some money in a bank account that provides interest

compounded yearly
and that you don't make any deposits or withdrawals.
Let's let <i>X</i> represent the amount of money in your account.
When the time comes for the bank to credit your interest
its
computer does so by multiplying <i>X</i> by some number. If the
interest rate were 10%
the number would be 1.1
and your new
balance would be 1.1 <i>X</i>. If your balance in the <i>n</i>'th
year is <i>Xn</i> (where <i>n</i> is 1 after the first year
2
after the second
and so forth)
your balance in the year <i>n</i>
+1 is
</p><p>
<i>Xn </i>+1 = <i>R Xn                     </i>(Eq. 1A)
</p><p>
where <i>R</i> is equal to 1.0 plus your interest rate. (<i>R</i>
is 1.1 in this example.)
</p><p>
You probably know that such compounding leads to exponential
growth. In terms of the initial amount <i>X</i>0
the amount in
your account after <i>n</i> years is
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i> = <i>X</i>0<i>Rn</i>                    (Eq. 1B)
</p><p>
After 50 years at 10% yearly interest
you will have $117.39 for
every dollar you initially had invested. The bank can afford to
do this only because of inflation and because money is loaned
at an even higher interest rate.
</p><p>
Equation 1A is applicable to more than compound interest. It's
how many of us have our salaries determined. It also describes
population growth. Imagine some species of bug that lives for
a season
lays its eggs
and then dies (thus avoiding the confusion
of overlapping generations). The next year the eggs hatch
and
the number of bugs is some constant <i>R</i> times the number
in the previous year. If <i>R</i> is less than 1
the bugs die
out over a number of years
and if <i>R</i> is greater than 1
their number grows exponentially.
</p><p>
You also know that exponential growth cannot go on forever
whether
it be bucks in the bank or people on the planet. Eventually something
happens
such as the depletion of resources
and the growth slows
and perhaps even reverses. Mass starvation
disease
crime
and
war are some of nature's mechanisms for limiting unbridled population
growth. Thus we need to modify the above equation in some way
if it is to model more closely growth patterns in nature.
</p><p>
Perhaps the simplest modification is to multiply the right-hand
side of Equation 1A by a term such as (1 - <i>X</i>) that is equal
to 1 if <i>X</i> is small (much less than 1) but which is less
than 1 as <i>X</i> increases. Since the growth slows to zero and
reverses as <i>X</i> approaches 1
we must think of <i>X</i> =
1 as representing some large number of dollars or bugs (say a
million or a billion); otherwise we would never get very far!
And so our modified equation
called the <i>logistic equation</i>

is
</p><p>
<i>Xn </i>+1 = <i>R Xn</i> (1 - <i>Xn</i>)                   
(Eq. 1C)
</p><p>
Now you're going to get your first homework assignment. Take
your pocket calculator
and start with a small value of <i>X</i>

say 0.1. To reduce the amount of work you have to do
use a fairly
large value of <i>R</i>
say 2
corresponding to a doubling every
year. Run <i>X</i> through Equation 1C a few times and see what
happens. This process is called <i>iteration</i>
and the successive
values are called <i>iterates</i>. If you did it right
you should
see that <i>X</i> grows rapidly for the first couple of steps

and then it levels off at a value of 0.5. The first few values
should be approximately 0.1
0.18
0.2952
0.4161
0.4859
0.4996

and 0.5. Compare your results with the unbounded growth of Equation
1A.
</p><p>
You might have predicted the above result
if you had thought
to set <i>Xn</i>+1 equal to <i>Xn</i> in Equation 1C and solved
for <i>Xn</i>. This value is called a <i>fixed-point </i>solution
of the equation
because if <i>X</i> ever has that value it will
remain fixed there forever. It is also sometimes called a <i>point
attractor</i>
because every initial value of <i>X</i> between
0 and 1 is attracted to the fixed point upon repeated iteration
of Equation 1C. Try initial values of <i>X</i> = 0.2 and <i>X</i>
= 0.8. A fixed point is also sometimes called a <i>critical point</i>

a <i>singular point</i>
or a <i>singularity</i>.
</p><p>
If you're curious
you might wonder what happens if you start
with a value of <i>X</i> less than 0
such as -0.1
or greater
than 1
such as 1.1. You should verify that the iterates are negative
and that they get larger and larger
eventually approaching minus
infinity. We say that the solution is <i>unbounded </i>and that
it <i>attracts to infinity</i>. Thus the values of <i>X</i> =
0 and <i>X</i> = 1 are like a watershed. Between these values
the solution is <i>bounded</i>
and outside these values it is
unbounded.
</p><p>
The region between <i>X</i> = 0 and <i>X</i> = 1 is called a
<i>basin of attraction</i> since it resembles a bathroom basin
in which drops of water find their way to the drain from wherever
they start. <i>X</i> = 0 is also a fixed point
but it is <i>unstable</i>
since values either slightly above or slightly below zero move
away from zero. Such an <i>unstable fixed point</i> is sometimes
called a <i>repellor</i>. Chaos results when two or more repellors
are present; the iterates then bounce back and forth like a baseball
runner caught in a squeeze play.
</p><p>
Equations that exhibit chaos have solutions that are unstable
but bounded; the solution never settles down to a fixed value

or even to a repeating pattern
but neither does it move off to
infinity. Sometimes we say that such equations are <i>linearly
unstable</i> but <i>nonlinearly stable</i>. Small perturbations
to the system grow
but the growth ceases when the nonlinear terms
become important
as eventually they must. Another way to say
it is that the fixed points are <i>locally unstable</i>
but the
system is <i>globally stable</i>. In such a case
initial conditions
are drawn to a special type of attractor
called a <i>strange
attractor</i>
which is not a point or even a finite set of points

but rather a complicated geometrical object whose properties constitute
the subject of this book.
</p><p>
See what happens if you substitute <i>X</i> = 0 or <i>X</i> =
1 into the logistic equation. As a check on your calculations

or in case you didn't do your homework
Table 1.1 shows the successive
iterates of <i>X</i> for each of the cases we have discussed.
</p><p>

<p>
An equation
such as the logistic equation
that predicts the
next value of a quantity from the previous value is called an
<i>iterated map</i> because it is like a road map in which each
point on the earth is mapped to a corresponding point on a piece
of paper. The logistic equation is a <i>one-dimensional </i>map
because the various <i>X</i>-values can be thought of as lying
along a straight line that stretches from minus infinity to plus
infinity. Each iteration of the map moves every point along the
line to a new position on the line. For the example above with
<i>R</i> = 2
all the points between <i>X</i> = 0 and <i>X</i>
= 1 walk toward <i>X</i> = 0.5
where they stop and remain. Other
points run faster and faster toward the end of the line that stretches
to minus infinity.
</p><p>
The logistic equation is an example of a <i>quadratic</i> iterated
map
so called because if you multiply out the right-hand side
of Equation 1C
it has not only a <i>linear</i> term <i>RXn</i>

but also a <i>quadratic</i> (squared) term -<i>RXn</i>2. Quadratic
maps are <i>noninvertable</i>
because you can find <i>Xn</i>+1
from <i>Xn</i>
but you can't go backwards because there are two
values of <i>Xn</i> that produce the same <i>Xn</i>+1
and there
is no way of knowing from which it came. For example
Table 1.1
shows that <i>X</i>0 = 0.2 and <i>X</i>0 = 0.8 both produce <i>X</i>1
= 0.32. These are the two roots of the quadratic equation that
you get if you try to solve for <i>Xn</i> in Equation 1C in terms
of X<i>n</i>+1.
</p><p>
The graph of <i>Xn</i>+1 versus <i>Xn</i> is a curve called a
<i>parabola</i>. Because a parabola is not a straight line
the
map is said to be <i>nonlinear</i>. Chaos and strange attractors
require a nonlinearity. The interesting and surprising behavior
of nonlinear iterated maps is the basis for much of this book.
</p><p>
The first surprising result occurs if you iterate Equation 1C
with <i>R</i> = 3.2 and an initial value of <i>X</i> in the range
of 0 to 1. After a few iterations the solution will alternate
between two values of approximately 0.5130 and 0.7995. This is
called a <i>period-2 limit cycle</i>. Like the fixed point
the
limit cycle is another type of simple attractor. It is sometimes
called a <i>periodic</i> or <i>cyclic</i> attractor.
</p><p>
It's not hard to see how cyclic behavior might arise in nature.
If the population of beetles grows too large
they will deplete
the plants on whom they depend for food. With too few plants

the beetles die out
allowing the number of plants to recover

leading to the next cycle of beetle growth
and so forth.
</p><p>
Increase <i>R</i> a bit more to 3.5
and repeat the calculation.
The result is a <i>period-4</i> limit cycle with four values of
approximately 0.5009
0.8750
0.3828
and 0.8269. If you keep
increasing <i>R</i> by ever smaller amounts
the period of the
limit cycle will double repeatedly
finally reaching chaotic behavior
(an infinite period) at about <i>R</i> = 3.5699456. This value
is sometimes called the <i>Feigenbaum point</i>
after Mitchell
J. Feigenbaum who discovered many of the interesting properties
of one-dimensional maps.
</p><p>
When chaos occurs
the successive iterates fluctuate in an apparently
random and irreproducible manner. The chaotic behavior persists
up to <i>R</i> = 4 except for an infinite number of small periodic
windows. For <i>R</i> greater than 4
the solution is unbounded

and the iterates attract rapidly to minus infinity.
</p><p>
The behavior described above can be summarized in a <i>bifurcation
diagram</i> as shown in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig1-01.gif">Figure 1-1</a> in which the limiting iterated
values of the logistic equation
after discarding the first few
hundred iterates
are plotted for a range of <i>R</i> from 2 to
4. This plot is called the <i>Feigenbaum diagram</i>
and it resembles
a tree on its side ("Feigenbaum
" appropriately but
coincidentally
is German for "fig tree"). You see the
fixed-point solution for <i>R</i> less than 3
the period-doubling
route to chaos
and the periodic windows at large <i>R</i>. The
chaotic regions toward the right side of the figure are characterized
by values of <i>X</i> that span a wide range and eventually fill
the region densely with points.</p><hr>

</p><p>
Each period doubling is called a <i>bifurcation</i>
since a
single solution splits into a pair of solutions. These splittings
are called <i>pitchfork bifurcations</i> for obvious reasons.
Note the period-3 window at about <i>R</i> = 3.84. The period-3
region begins abruptly when <i>R</i> is increased slightly from
within the chaotic region to its left in what is called a <i>tangent
</i>or <i>saddle-node </i>bifurcation. Careful inspection of the
period-3 window shows that it also undergoes a period-doubling
sequence at about <i>R</i> = 3.85. Solutions with every period
can be found somewhere between <i>R</i> = 3 and <i>R</i> = 4.
</p><p>
Successive period doublings occur with ever increasing rapidity
as one moves from left to right in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig1-01.gif">Figure 1-1</a>. The ratio of the
width of each region to the width of the previous region approaches
a constant equal to about 4.6692
called the <i>Feigenbaum number</i>.
Even more remarkable is that this number arises in many different
chaotic systems in nature as well as in the solutions of equations.
The <i>universality</i> of the Feigenbaum number in chaos is reminiscent
of the ubiquity of the number ¹ in Euclidean geometry.
</p><p>
With <i>R</i> = 4
the solutions occupy the entire interval from
<i>X</i> = 0 to <i>X</i> = 1. Eventually <i>X</i> will take on
a value arbitrarily close to any point in that interval (a characteristic
called <i>topological transitivity</i>). Curiously
however
there
are infinitely many initial values of <i>X</i> that don't lead
to a chaotic solution even for <i>R</i> = 4. For example <i>X</i>0
= 0.5 and <i>X</i>0 = 0.75 lead to unstable fixed points
while
<i>X</i>0 = 0.345491... and <i>X</i>0 = 0.904508... produce an
unstable period-2 limit cycle. By <i>unstable</i>
we mean that
if the initial values are wrong by even the slightest amount

successive iterates will wander ever farther away.
</p><p>
Even through there are infinitely many non-chaotic initial values
between zero and one
the chance that you will find one by randomly
guessing is negligible. For every such value
there are infinitely
many others that produce chaos. Such a seemingly paradoxical entity
is an example of a <i>Cantor set</i>
named after the nineteenth-century
German mathematician Georg Cantor who is often credited with developing
a mathematically rigorous concept of infinity.
</p><p>
A Cantor set contains infinitely many members (in fact
<i>uncountably</i>
infinitely many)
but its members represent a zero fraction of
the total! For example
infinitely many points are required to
cover completely the circumference of a circle
but this number
of points doesn't even begin to cover its interior. Such a collection
(or set) of points
although infinite in number
is said to comprise
a <i>set of measure zero</i>
because the points fill a negligible
portion of the plane. An attractor is a set of measure zero
but
its basin of attraction has a non-zero measure.
</p><p>
Few people would have guessed that such complexity could arise
from such underlying simplicity. Furthermore
the logistic equation
is only the simplest of an endless variety of equations that can
exhibit chaos. It is this dichotomy of simplicity and complexity
that makes chaos beautiful to the mathematician and artist alike.
In the bifurcation diagram of the logistic equation
we have something
with aesthetic appeal
and it came from a simple quadratic equation!
</p><p>
<b>1.3  The Butterfly Effect</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>If our goal is to seek chaotic behavior in the solution
of equations
we need a simple way to test for chaos. For this
purpose we use the fact that chaotic processes exhibit extreme
sensitivity to initial conditions
in contrast to <i>regular</i>
processes where different starting points usually converge to
the same sequence of points on a simple attractor.
</p><p>
Suppose we iterate the logistic equation with two initial values
of <i>X</i> that differ by only a tiny amount. Think of these
values as representing two states of the atmosphere that differ
only by the flapping of the wings of a butterfly. If successive
iterates are attracted to a fixed point as they are for <i>R</i>
= 2
the difference between the two solutions must get smaller
and smaller as the fixed point is approached. A similar thing
happens for a limit cycle. The difference between the two solutions
will on average decrease exponentially.
</p><p>
If the solution is chaotic
as is the logistic equation for <i>R</i>
= 4
the successive iterates for the two cases will initially
on average get farther apart; the difference usually grows exponentially.
If the difference doubles on average with every iteration
we
say the <i>Lyapunov exponent</i> is 1. If it is reduced by half

we say the Lyapunov exponent is -1. The name comes from the late
nineteenth-century Russian mathematician Aleksandr M. Lyapunov
(sometimes transliterated <i>Liapunov</i> or <i>Ljapunov</i>).
</p><p>
You can think of the Lyapunov exponent as the power of 2 by which
the difference between two nearly equal <i>X</i>-values changes
on average for each iteration. Thus the difference between the
values changes by an average of 2<i>L</i> for each iteration.
If <i>L</i> is negative
the solutions approach one another; if
<i>L</i> is positive
we have sensitivity to initial conditions
and hence chaos.
</p><p>
One way to detect chaos is to iterate the equation with two nearly
equal initial values and see if after many iterations
the values
are closer together or farther apart. Another way is to make use
of a principle of calculus that says that the difference in the
solutions after one iteration divided by the difference before
the iteration
provided the difference is small
is equal to the
<i>derivative</i> of the equation for the map
which for the logistic
equation is
</p><p>
D<i>Xn</i>+1 / D<i>Xn</i> = <i>R</i>(1 - 2<i>Xn</i>)         
(Eq. 1D)
</p><p>
where D<i>X</i> is the difference between the two values of <i>X</i>.
In Equation 1D
Æ<i>Xn</i> is the difference in the <i>X</i>
values after <i>n</i> iterations
and Æ<i>Xn</i>+1 is the
difference after <i>n</i>+1 iterations.
</p><p>
Since D<i>X</i> increases by the factor on the right of Equation
1D for each iteration
the proper way to calculate the average
is to start with a value of 1 and multiply it repeatedly by the
right-hand side of Equation 1D at each iteration
then divide
the result by the number of iterations
and finally take the logarithm
to the base 2 of the absolute value of the result to get the Lyapunov
exponent. If you prefer an equation
the above description is
equivalent to
</p><p>
<i>L</i> = S log2 |<i>R</i> (1 - 2<i>Xn</i>)| / <i>N</i>     
(Eq. 1E)
</p><p>
where the vertical bars mean that you are to disregard the sign
of the quantity inside and S means to sum the quantity to its
right from a value of <i>n</i> = 1 to a value of <i>n</i> = <i>N</i>

where <i>N</i> is some large number. The larger the value of
<i>N</i>
the more accurate is the estimate of <i>L</i>.
</p><p>
Suppose you knew the value of <i>X</i> to within 0.01 for an
iterated map with <i>L</i> = 1. After one iteration the uncertainty
would be about 0.02
and after two iterations the uncertainty
would be about 0.04
and so forth. After about seven iterations

the error would exceed 1
and your prediction would be totally
worthless. If the <i>X</i>-values are expressed as binary numbers

each iteration would result in throwing away the right-most binary
digit (<i>bit</i>). Thus the units of <i>L</i> are <i>bits per
iteration</i>. The Lyapunov exponent is the rate at which information
is lost when a map is iterated.
</p><p>
It is as if a succession of cartographers each copied maps from
one another
but every time one was copied it was only half as
accurate as the previous one. If the original map were accurate
to 1%
the next copy would be accurate to 2%
and the seventh
generation copy would bear no relation to the original. If the
Lyapunov exponent were -1
one bit of information would be <i>gained</i>
at each iteration. Even a completely unknown initial condition
would eventually be perfectly accurate as it approached the known
fixed point or limit cycle. Unfortunately
negative Lyapunov exponents
are not the rule in cartography; otherwise all our maps would
be self-correcting!
</p><p>
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig1-02.gif">Figure 1-2</a> shows the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic equation
using values of <i>R</i> from 2 to 4. The Lyapunov exponent is
1.0 at <i>R</i> = 4
since that value causes the interval of <i>X</i>
from 0 to 1 to be mapped backed onto itself with a single fold
at <i>X</i> = 0.5. Thus information is lost at a rate of 1 bit
per iteration
since each iterate has two possible predecessors.
You can also see some of the periodic windows where <i>L</i> dips
below zero toward the right edge of the plot. Also note that <i>L</i>
is zero wherever a bifurcation occurs. At these points the solution
is fraught with indecision over which branch to take
and the
initial uncertainty persists forever
neither increasing nor decreasing.

<b>1.4  The Computer Artist</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>By now you have probably surmised that the operations
described above are best carried out by a computer. The equations
are simple
but they must be applied repeatedly. This is precisely
the kind of task at which computers excel.
</p><p>
There are dozens of computer types and programming languages
to choose from. Currently the most popular computers are those
based on the IBM PC running the MS-DOS or IBM-DOS operating system
(hereafter
simply called DOS). The most widely available programming
language is BASIC (<b>B</b>eginner's <b>A</b>ll-purpose <b>S</b>ymbolic
<b>I</b>nstruction <b>C</b>ode)
which usually comes bundled with
the operating system software included with the computer. A version
of BASIC called QBASIC has been included with DOS since version
5.0. BASIC may not be the most advanced computer language
but
it is one of the easiest to learn and to use
its commands are
close to ordinary English
and it is more than adequate for our
purposes. Furthermore
modern versions of BASIC compare favorably
with the best of the other languages.
</p><p>
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has established
a standard for the BASIC language
but it is somewhat limited

and most versions of BASIC have many additions and embellishments.
We will intentionally use a primitive dialect to ensure compatibility
with most modern implementations and to simplify the translation
into incompatible versions. In particular
the programs in this
book should run without modification under Microsoft BASICA
GW-BASIC

QBASIC
QuickBASIC
VisualBASIC for MS-DOS; Borland International
TurboBASIC (no longer available); and Spectra Publishing PowerBASIC
on IBM PCs or compatibles. You will be happiest using a modern
compiled BASIC such as VisualBASIC or PowerBASIC on a fast computer
with a math coprocessor.
</p><p>
Appendix C includes information on translating the computer programs
into other
partially incompatible dialects of BASIC
as well
as source code for use with VisualBASIC for Windows and Microsoft
QuickBASIC for the Macintosh. Appendix D contains a translation
into Microsoft QuickC. The BASIC programs use line numbers
which
have been obsolete since the mid 1980's
but they are harmless

and they provide a convenient way to reference lines of the program
and to indicate where in the program a change is to be made.
</p><p>
If you follow sequentially through this book
you will only need
to add and change a few lines of the program as you meet each
new idea. Your program will gradually grow more versatile as you
work through the book. In the end you will have a powerful program
that can reproduce all the examples in this book as well as an
endless variety of new ones. Hence you should avoid the temptation
to eliminate or to change the line numbers
at least until you
have a fully functional program. You may prefer to jump to Appendix
B where you will find the complete final program
which is also
provided on the accompanying disk along with source listings in
BASIC
Microsoft QuickC
Borland TurboC++ and a ready-to-run executable
version of the program.
</p><p>
If you are an experienced programmer
you might ridicule some
of the quaint program listings. Many powerful programming structures
such as block IF statements
DO LOOPs
and callable subroutines
with local variables that produce beautifully structured programs
are now standard
but they have been avoided to allow backwards
compatibility with more primitive versions of BASIC. They also
often impose a small speed penalty. The dreaded GOTO statement
has been used primarily to bypass blocks of code in deference
to BASIC versions that don't support block IF statements. Lines
of the program that are bypassed by a GOTO are usually indented.
Blocks of the program contained within FOR...NEXT loops have also
been indented. In the interest of structure and simplicity
the
programs have been written using numerous small modular subroutines

each with a single entry point beginning with a comment line

and a single exit point containing a RETURN statement
albeit
with global variables. The individual subroutines are separated
with blank lines. It should be relatively easy for an experienced
programmer to rewrite the program in a more modern format.
</p><p>
The program listing <b>PROG01</b> iterates the logistic equation
for <i>R</i> = 4 with an initial value of <i>X</i> = 0.05 and
makes a graph of each iterate versus its predecessor. The program
looks more complicated than it is because the various operations
have been relegated to subroutines to provide a template for the
more versatile cases to follow.

If when you first run the program your computer reports an error

it will probably be in one of the following lines:
</p><p>
<b> Line 1010:</b>  Be sure your version of BASIC supports double-precision
(four-byte) floating-point variables. If it doesn't
you may omit
this line
but you will then probably have to change the 4 in
line 1560 to 3.99999 to avoid overflow resulting from round-off
errors. With modern versions of BASIC and a computer with a math
coprocessor
there is no penalty
and considerable advantage

in using double precision. Because of the finite precision of
computer arithmetic
all cases will eventually repeat
but with
double precision
the average number of iterations required before
this happens is acceptably large.
</p><p>
<b> Line 1320:</b>  Either your version of BASIC doesn't require
this command or your computer or compiler doesn't support VGA
graphics. Try reducing the 12 in line 1030 to a lower number until
you find one that works. If none work
try eliminating line 1320
altogether.
</p><p>
<b> Line 1350:</b>  The WINDOW command defines the coordinates
of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the graphics window
for subsequent PSET and LINE commands. If your version of BASIC
doesn't support this command
you will have to delete this line
and convert all the parameters in the PSET and LINE commands to
address screen pixels. In such a case
try replacing line 2300
with PSET (200 * <i>X</i>
200 - 200 * <i>XNEW</i>). One advantage
of using the WINDOW command is that when a version of BASIC comes
along that supports higher screen resolutions
the program can
be easily recompiled to take advantage of it.

</p><p>
The logistic parabola comes from a chaotic solution
but it doesn't
look very complicated
and it would hardly qualify as art. With
one small change we can make things more interesting while at
the same time illustrating the sensitivity to initial conditions.
Instead of plotting each iterate versus its immediate predecessor

we could plot it versus its second or third or fourth predecessor.
Let's save the last 500 iterates and provide the option to plot
<i>X</i> versus any one of them.
</p><p>
The <i>changes</i> that you need to make in the program <b>PROG01</b>
to accomplish this are shown in the listing <b>PROG02</b>. You
can either go through the program and change or add lines as necessary
or type the listing and save it in ASCII format and then use the
MERGE command that is supported by many (mostly old) versions
of BASIC to update the previous version of the program.

</p><p>
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig1-04.gif">Figure 1-4</a> provides a good graphical illustration of the sensitivity
to initial conditions. The horizontal axis represents all possible
initial conditions from zero to one. The vertical axis shows the
value from zero to one corresponding to each initial condition
after five iterations. It's not hard to see that two nearby points
on the horizontal axis usually translate into two very different
values along the vertical axis after five iterations. Try using
<i>PREV%</i> = 10
and convince yourself that information about
the initial condition is almost completely lost after ten iterations.
</p><p>
This exercise provides a good insight into the way a strange
attractor is formed geometrically. The logistic parabola
which
began as a line (a one-dimensional object)
is stretched and folded
with each iteration
eventually filling the entire plane (a two-dimensional
object) after many iterations. Perhaps it reminds you of those
taffy machines that repeatedly stretch and fold the taffy
causing
two nearby specks in the taffy after a while to be nowhere near
one another. On average the distance between the specks initially
increases at an exponential rate.
</p><p>
You should be able to think of many other examples of the sensitivity
to initial conditions. When you stir your coffee to mix in the
cream
you're relying on a chaotic process. Two sticks dropped
into the water close together just above a waterfall eventually
end up far apart. Try laying two
identical
garden hoses side
by side
and turn on the water in each one at the same time without
holding the ends. Chaotic processes are all around us. Their mathematical
solutions usually produce chaotic strange attractors
whose diversity
and beauty we are about to explore.
</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 2</b>
</p><p>
<b>Wiggly Lines</b>
</p><p>
In this chapter we will teach the computer to search for chaotic
solutions of simple equations with a single variable. The solutions
are segments of lines
but the lines can wiggle in an incredibly
complicated manner.
</p><p>
<b>2.1  More Knobs to Twiddle</b>
</p><p>
The logistic equation (Equation 1C) is an example of a <i>dynamical
system</i>. Such systems are described by deterministic initial-value
equations. This particular system has a single parameter <i>R</i>
whose value determines the solution's behavior for all initial
values of <i>X</i> within the basin of attraction. It's like a
knob on a radio or on a stove that you can turn up or down to
control the sound emitted by the radio or the convection in a
pot of boiling soup.
</p><p>
There is a simple experiment you can do to observe the period-doubling
route to chaos. Go into your bathroom or kitchen and turn on the
tap
but only slightly
to produce a regular periodic pattern
of drips. Now slowly open the tap until the pattern becomes chaotic.
Just before the onset of chaos
if you are sufficiently careful
and patient
you should observe one or more period doublings where
the sound changes to something like--drip drip - drip drip - drip
drip. The knob that controls the flow rate corresponds to the
parameter <i>R</i> in the logistic equation. The dripping faucet
has been extensively studied by Robert Shaw and discussed at length
in his book <i>The Dripping Faucet as a Model Chaotic System</i>
.
</p><p>
Most dynamical systems have more than one knob. Your kitchen
faucet probably has independent control of the flow rate and the
temperature of the water. With more knobs
you might expect to
increase the variety of ways the system can behave. Such knobs
are called <i>control parameters</i>.
</p><p>
The formula for the most general one-dimensional quadratic iterated
map is
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2
(Eq. 2A)
</p><p>
Here we have three control parameters--<i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and
<i>a</i>3. By exploring all combinations of their values
we expect
eventually to observe every possible peculiar solution that the
equation can have.
</p><p>
You might think that the initial condition <i>X</i>0 is a fourth
knob
but if the system is chaotic
the solution is generally
a strange attractor
and all initial conditions within the basin
of attraction look the same after many iterations. Of course there
is no guarantee that a particular choice of <i>X</i>0 lies within
the basin
but values of <i>X</i>0 close to zero are within the
basin about half the time
and there are so many chaotic solutions
over the range of the other three parameters that we can well
afford to discard half of them.
</p><p>
The search for strange attractors proceeds as follows. Choose
values for <i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3 arbitrarily. Start
with a value of <i>X</i>0 near zero. Iterate Equation 2A repeatedly
until the solution either exceeds some large number
in which
case it is presumably unbounded
or until the Lyapunov exponent
becomes small or negative
in which case the solution is probably
a fixed point or limit cycle. In either event
choose a different
combination of <i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3
and start
over. If
after a few thousand iterations
the solution is bounded
(<i>X</i> is not enormous) and the Lyapunov exponent is positive

then it is likely that you have found a strange attractor.
</p><p>
<b>2.2  Randomness and Pseudo-randomness</b>
</p><p>
To choose values of <i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3
we can
use the random number generator provided with most computer languages.
The random numbers thus produced are usually uniformly distributed
between zero and one. You may wonder how a computer
the epitome
of determinism
could ever produce a random number. This question
deserves a digression since the answer provides yet another example
of the very issues we have been discussing.
</p><p>
One way to produce a random number is to start with a value of
<i>X</i> (the <i>seed</i>) between zero and one and iterate the
logistic equation with <i>R</i> = 4 a hundred or so times. The
result is a new number in the range of zero to one that is related
to the seed in a complicated and sensitive way. This number is
then used as the seed for the next random number
which is produced
in the same way. A given seed will produce the same sequence of
random numbers
but the sequence may not be the same on different
computers or with different languages or even with different versions
of the same language because of the way the numbers are rounded.
</p><p>
However
this method of producing random numbers is not optimal.
First
the numbers are not uniformly distributed over the range.
They tend to cluster near zero and one as the darkness of the
right-hand side of <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig1-01.gif">Figure 1-1</a> suggests. Also
multiplying a non-integer
number by itself a hundred times is a relatively slow process
on a computer.
</p><p>
Instead
computers usually get their random numbers using the
<i>linear congruential method:</i>
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = (<i>aXn</i> + <i>b</i>) mod<i> c</i>          (Eq.
2B)
</p><p>
where the mod (<i>modulus</i>) operation means to divide the quantity
on its left (<i>aXn</i> + <i>b</i>) by the quantity on its right
(<i>c</i>)
and keep the remainder rather than the quotient. All
the quantities in Equation 2B are integers. The constants <i>a</i>

<i>b</i>
and <i>c</i> are carefully chosen to maximize the number
of steps required for the sequence to repeat
which in any case
can never exceed <i>c</i>. The numbers are uniformly distributed
from zero to <i>c</i> - 1
but they can be transformed to the
range zero to one by simply dividing <i>Xn</i>+1 by <i>c</i>.
The numbers appear to be random
but since they are produced using
a deterministic procedure
they are often called <i>pseudo-random</i>.
Equation 2B is another example of a one-dimensional chaotic map

called a <i>shift map</i>.
</p><p>
There are infinitely many conditions that truly random numbers
should satisfy. Not only must the numbers be uniform over the
interval
but there should be no detectable relation between the
numbers and any of their predecessors. In particular
the sequence
should repeat only after a very large number of steps. Most random
number generators are deficient in certain ways. For example

the random numbers produced by Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.5 repeat
after 16
777
216 steps
and this number is too small for some
of our purposes.
</p><p>
The situation can be greatly improved by shuffling the numbers.
Suppose we maintain a table of a hundred or so random numbers.
When we want one
we randomly take an entry from the table and
replace it with a new random number. With this simple modification

the pseudo-random numbers generated by the computer are sufficiently
random for all our needs.
</p><p>
You should always remember that the sequence of random numbers
generated by a digital computer will eventually repeat. You must
take care to ensure that over the duration of a calculation
such
a repetition does not occur. You must also reseed the random number
generator using a truly random seed
such as one based on the
time of day the program is started if you are to avoid repeating
the same sequence each time you run the program.
</p><p>
<b>2.3  What's in a Name?</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>When we begin to choose random values for the coefficients
<i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3
we are immediately confronted
with two issues. The first is the range of values that the coefficients
may have
and the second is the amount by which two values of
a coefficient must differ to produce attractors that are visibly
different.
</p><p>
The first issue can be addressed by referring to the logistic
equation (Equation 1C). When the value of <i>R</i> is too small
(less than about 3.5)
there are no chaotic solutions
and when
the value of <i>R</i> is too large (greater than 4)
all the solutions
are unbounded. A similar situation occurs for the more general
one-dimensional quadratic map in Equation 2A. Thus we want to
limit the coefficients to values whose magnitude (positive or
negative) is of order unity. That is to say
0.1 is probably too
small a value
and 10 is probably unnecessarily large. This assumption
can be verified by numerical experiment.
</p><p>
The second issue requires a subjective judgment of how dissimilar
two attractors must look before we consider them to be different.
In practice
a change in one of the coefficients by an amount
of order 0.1 will generally produce an object that is noticeably
different. If we let each coefficient take on values ranging from
-1.2 to 1.2 in steps of 0.1
we will have 25 possible values

and we can associate each with a letter of the alphabet
A through
Y and have a convenient way to catalog and replicate the attractors.
Limiting the coefficients to 25 values may seem excessively restrictive

but since there are three coefficients for one-dimensional quadratic
maps
there are 253 or 15
625 different combinations.
</p><p>
The coefficients that correspond to the logistic equation with
<i>R</i> = 4 are <i>a</i>1 = 0
<i>a</i>2 = 4
and <i>a</i>3 =
-4
and they fall outside the range of -1.2 to 1.2. Thus for some
purposes
it will be convenient to take a larger range. A convenient
way to extend the range is to use the ASCII (<b>A</b>merican <b>S</b>tandard
<b>C</b>ode for <b>I</b>nformation <b>I</b>nterchange) character
set summarized in Table 2.1.

ASCII codes from 0 to 31 are reserved for control codes--things
like backspace
carriage return
and line feed. Codes from 128
to 255 can also be used
but there is no universal character set
associated with them. By making use of all the ASCII characters
from 0 to 255
we can accommodate coefficients in the range of
-7.7 to 17.8. The characters listed in the table will suffice
for most of our needs
however.
</p><p>
With such a coding scheme
each attractor is represented by a
sequence of characters
with each character corresponding to one
of the coefficients. The sequence can be thought of as the name
of the attractor. We will preface the name with a character that
indicates the type of equation we are dealing with. Let's use
the letter A to represent one-dimensional quadratic maps. Thus
the logistic equation coded in this way is AMu%. Note that the
letters in the name are case sensitive (u and U are different)

and so you should be careful when typing them. Such names may
look strange
which is perhaps appropriate for strange attractors

and you shouldn't try to pronounce them! However
they do provide
a convenient and compact method for saving everything you need
to reproduce an attractor.
</p><p>
<b>2.4  The Computer Search</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>Before embarking on a search for strange attractors we
need to generalize the formula for the Lyapunov exponent given
in Equation 1E for the logistic equation. The generalization is
easily obtained using differential calculus
and the result is
</p><p>
<i>L</i> = S log2 |<i>a</i>2 + 2<i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>| / <i>N</i>
(Eq. 2C)
</p><p>
The program changes that are required to perform a search for
strange attractors in one-dimensional quadratic iterated maps
are given in the listing <b>PROG03</b>.

<p>
There are several things to note about the listing <b>PROG03</b>:
</p><p>
1. The maximum number of iterations (<i>NMAX</i> in line 1050)
has been set arbitrarily to 11
000. This is the number of iterations
after which a strange attractor is assumed to have been found
if the magnitude of <i>X</i> is less than one million and the
Lyapunov exponent is positive (actually greater than 0.005). You
may wish to decrease <i>NMAX</i> to speed the rate at which attractors
are found or increase <i>NMAX</i> if you have a very fast computer
or want to give the displays more time to develop. The number
of iterations is a parameter that you can adjust for the most
visually appealing result. Most of the figures in this book were
made with <i>NMAX</i> between about half a million and ten million

and required between about a minute and an hour to produce.
</p><p>
2. The seed for the random number generator is taken in line
1160 as the number of seconds lapsed since midnight (TIMER). This
choice ensures that a new sequence of random numbers is produced
each time the program is run
except in the unlikely event that
it is run at exactly the same time each day.
</p><p>
3. After 1000 iterations (line 2200)
the screen is resized and
erased by the subroutine in lines 3100 through 3460 using the
minimum and maximum values of <i>X</i> between the hundredth and
thousandth iteration
allowing a ten percent border around the
attractor.
</p><p>
4. To save time
the difference between each value of <i>X</i>
and its predecessor is evaluated in line 2470
and if the difference
is less than one millionth
the solution is assumed to be a fixed
point even if the Lyapunov exponent is still positive.
</p><p>
5. The Lyapunov exponent is not used as a criterion until after
100 iterations (line 2480) to ensure that its value is reasonably
accurate.
</p><p>
6. The coefficients of the equation are chosen in line 2710 using
random numbers which have been shuffled by the subroutine in lines
2800 though 2850 to minimize the chance of repeating the same
search sequence.
</p><p>
The criterion for detecting a strange attractor is somewhat subjective.
There will always be borderline cases for which no amount of computing
will suffice to distinguish between a strange attractor and a
periodic solution with a very long period. However
our interest
here is in finding visually interesting attractors quickly
and
so we can afford to make occasional mistakes. Such mistakes account
for only a small number of cases.
</p><p>
Of the 15
625 combinations of coefficients
exactly 364 (2.3%)
of them are chaotic by these criteria. Some of the more visually
interesting ones are shown in Figures 2-1 through 2-4 in which
the values are plotted versus their fifth previous iterate. For
each case
the code and the Lyapunov exponent are shown at the
top of the graph.</p><hr>

The search for strange attractors is potentially time-consuming
if you have an old computer without a math coprocessor or if you
are using a BASIC <i>interpreter</i> rather than a <i>compiler</i>.
Even if the search is reasonably fast on your computer
be forewarned
that it will slow down considerably as you advance to the more
complicated equations later in the book. Perhaps this is a good
time to summarize some of your options for making the program
run faster.
</p><p>
When comparing calculation speeds of various computers and compilers

it is important to do the comparison with the actual program or
with a benchmark that accurately reflects its mix of instructions

graphics
and disk access. With computer speeds doubling approximately
every two years
speed will eventually cease to be a consideration
for the calculations described in this book. Meanwhile
you need
to consider the alternatives.
</p><p>
Table 2.2 lists the average number of strange attractors found
by <b>PROG03</b> per hour using various versions of BASIC on a
33 MHz
80486DX-based computer with and without a math coprocessor.
The exact numbers are less important than the relative values.
They provide a good indication of how the various versions of
BASIC compare on calculations of the type that will be used throughout
this book.

QuickBASIC and VisualBASIC for MS-DOS can be run from the editor
environment
where they function much like an interpreter
or
they can be used to compile a stand-alone executable program.
VisualBASIC can be compiled with either of two floating point
math packages; the <i>alternate</i> package is faster for machines
without a coprocessor
and the <i>emulate</i> package is faster
for machines with a coprocessor. TurboBASIC is now obsolete and
has been replaced by PowerBASIC. PowerBASIC
like VisualBASIC

can be compiled with either of two floating point math packages;
the <i>procedure</i> package is similar to the VisualBASIC alternate
package. A third math package
<i>NPX (87)</i> is the same as
emulate except that it will not work on a machine without a math
coprocessor. The tests were done with all error trapping turned
off
which is inadvisable until you have a thoroughly debugged
program.
</p><p>
If you launch the program from Microsoft Windows
you might find
the computation speeds considerably different from those in Table
2.2. In one test
the PowerBASIC speeds were cut in half
and
the QuickBASIC speeds were increased slightly from the values
obtained when the program was run directly from DOS. You should
do your own speed tests to see what configuration provides the
optimum performance on your computer and operating system.
</p><p>
The executable program on the disk that accompanies this book
was compiled with PowerBASIC using the procedure package. If you
have PowerBASIC and a math coprocessor
you can recompile the
program using the emulate or NPX (87) package to achieve a slight
improvement in speed.
</p><p>
<b>2.5  Wiggles on Wiggles</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>The preceding figures consist of segments of wiggly lines

and thus they are not very artistic. To make things more interesting

we can consider one-dimensional maps of higher order. By this
we mean that we will not stop with quadratic (<i>X</i>2) maps
but we will consider equations containing <i>cubic</i> (<i>X</i>3)

<i>quartic</i> (<i>X</i>4)
<i>quintic</i> (<i>X</i>5)
and even
higher terms.
</p><p>
In one sense
considering higher-order terms is equivalent to
plotting each iterate versus an iterate earlier than the immediately
previous one. For example
two successive iterations of the second-order
Equation 2A yields
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+2 = <i>a</i>1(1+<i>a</i>2+<i>a</i>1<i>a</i>3) + (<i>a</i>3<i>a</i>2+2<i>a</i>1<i>a</i>3)<i>Xn</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 2D)
</p><p>
+ <i>a</i>3(<i>a</i>2+2<i>a</i>1<i>a</i>3+<i>a</i>22)<i>Xn</i>2
+ 2<i>a</i>2<i>a</i>32<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>33<i>Xn</i>4
</p><p>
which is a fourth-order <i>polynomial</i>. However
there are
only three parameters <i>a</i>1
<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3
from
which the five coefficients are uniquely determined.
</p><p>
A simpler and more general procedure is to allow each term in
the polynomial to have its own coefficient
which for fifth order
gives
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>4<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>5<i>Xn</i>4 + <i>a</i>6<i>Xn</i>5
(Eq. 2E) 
</p><p>
With six coefficients
each with 25 possible values
there are
256 or about 244 million different combinations. Even if only
a small percentage of them is chaotic
we would have to look at
one every second for about a year before we would see them all.
</p><p>
The generalization of the expression for the Lyapunov exponent
for a fifth-order map is given by
</p><p>
<i>L</i> = S log2 |<i>a</i>2 + 2<i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i> + 3<i>a</i>4<i>Xn</i>2
+ 4<i>a</i>5<i>Xn</i>3 + 5<i>a</i>6<i>Xn</i>4| / <i>N</i>    
(Eq. 2C)
</p><p>
With these equations in hand
you can easily modify the program
as in <b>PROG04</b> to search for one-dimensional attractors of
up to fifth order. In our coding scheme
a first letter of B will
represent third order
C will represent fourth order
and D will
represent fifth order. The program is written so that even higher
orders can be produced by changing the quantity <i>OMAX%</i> in
line 1060.

The objects are still segments of lines
but the wiggles themselves
have wiggles
and the underlying determinism is less obvious than
before.</p><hr>

<b>2.6  Making Music</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>If the preceding figures don't qualify as art
perhaps
they qualify as music. Since the quantity <i>X</i> behaves in
a deterministic yet unpredictable way
it may be that a sequence
of musical notes determined by <i>X</i> will mimic the order and
unpredictability that characterize music. It's easy to test.
</p><p>
Suppose we allow the notes to span three octaves from A-220 to
A-1760. The letter refers to the musical note
and the numbers
refer to the frequency in cycles per second (called <i>Hertz</i>).
We'll allow the notes to take one of twelve distinct values corresponding
to the <i>even-tempered scale</i> and for simplicity take all
the notes to be of the same duration. Thus the range of possible
values of <i>X</i> is divided into 36 intervals
and each successive
iterate of <i>X</i> is converted into the corresponding musical
note. The listing <b>PROG05</b> shows the changes necessary to
accomplish this.

<p>
The program allows you to toggle the sound on and off by pressing
the <b>S</b> key. Pressing any other key exits the program. You
might wish to experiment with the duration <i>DUR</i> of the SOUND
statement in line 3520. Increasing its value from 1 (corresponding
to approximately 0.055 seconds) makes the sounds more musical

but the calculation will then take longer.
</p><p>
The use of sound to help interpret data generated by a computer
is a technique that is relatively unexplored. The method is sometimes
called <i>sonification</i>. In some cases
patterns and structure
in data can be more readily discerned audibly than visually. This
technique was used to advantage in interpreting data from the
Voyager spacecraft as it detected plasma waves near Jupiter and
micrometeorites as it crossed through the rings of Saturn. The
repetitive sound of a simple limit cycle contrasts sharply with
the non-repetitive waverings of a chaotic time series.

<b>CHAPTER 3</b>
</p><p>
<b>Pieces of Planes</b>
</p><p>
Whereas the last chapter dealt with one-dimensional maps whose
graphs are segments of lines
this chapter will deal with two-dimensional
maps whose graphs are pieces of planes
and which thus produce
much more interesting displays. This chapter provides the minimum
tools for creating attractors that genuinely qualify as art. With
only the information contained here
the variety of available
patterns is so great that you hardly need to proceed beyond this
chapter
but if you do stop here
you will miss some delightful
surprises.
</p><p>
<b>3.1  Quadratic Maps in Two Dimensions</b>
</p><p>
In the discussion so far
the maps have involved a single variable
<i>X</i> whose value changes with each iteration of the equation.
Such maps are said to be <i>one-dimensional</i> because the values
of <i>X</i> can be thought of as lying along a line
and a line
is a one-dimensional object. By plotting each value of <i>X</i>
versus a previous value of <i>X</i>
the line can be made to wiggle
with considerable complexity
but it always remains a line
and
lines are of limited interest and beauty.
</p><p>
The situation is more interesting if we consider iterated maps
that involve two variables
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. In such a case

each iterate produces a point in a plane
where <i>X</i>
by convention

represents the horizontal coordinate and <i>Y</i> represents the
vertical coordinate of the point. With successive iteration
the
points fill in some portion of the plane. The visually interesting
cases
as usual
are the chaotic ones.
</p><p>
Such two-dimensional maps might arise
for example
from an ecological
model only slightly more complicated than the logistic equation.
A classic example is the <i>predator-prey problem</i> in which
<i>X</i> represents the prey and <i>Y</i> the predator. In a simple
linear model
the solution is a fixed point (a unique number of
rabbits and foxes) or a limit cycle (the number of rabbits and
foxes oscillate
reaching their maximum values at different times

but eventually repeating). When nonlinear terms are introduced
into the model
the population of each species can behave chaotically.
You can think of each point that makes up such an attractor as
the population of rabbits and foxes in successive years. Since
such complexity arises from these very simple models
it's easy
to understand why ecologists might have trouble predicting the
fate of biological species!
</p><p>
Perhaps the best known chaotic two-dimensional map is the <i>Hénon
map</i> (proposed by the French astronomer Michel Hénon
in 1976)
whose equations are
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = 1 + <i>aXn</i>2 + <i>bYn</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 3A)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>Xn</i>
</p><p>
The quantities <i>a</i> and b are the control parameters
analogous
to <i>R</i> in the logistic equation. Hénon used the values
a = -1.4 and b = 0.3. The necessary nonlinearity is provided by
the <i>X</i>2-term in the first equation. The Hénon map
is special
in that the net contraction of a set of initial points
covering an area of the <i>XY</i>-plane is constant with each
iteration. The area occupied by the points is 30% of the area
at the previous iteration (from the <i>bYn</i>-term). Other values
of <i>b</i> can be used
but not all values produce chaotic solutions.
Unlike the logistic map
the Hénon map is invertable; there
is a unique value for <i>Xn</i> and <i>Yn</i> corresponding to
each <i>Xn</i>+1 and <i>Yn</i>+1. You may have seen an alternate
form of the Hénon equations in which the factor <i>b</i>
appears instead in the second equation. The result of repeated
iteration of Equations 3A is shown in Figure 3-1.</p><hr>

<b><a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-01.gif">Figure 3-1</a>. The Hénon Map</b>
</p><p>
The resulting graph is more than a line but less than a surface.
What resembles a single line is a pair of lines
each one of which
in turn is another pair of lines
and so forth to however close
you look or whatever magnification you choose. This <i>self-similarity</i>
is a common characteristic of a class of objects that are called
<i>fractals</i>.
</p><p>
Fractals are to chaos what geometry is to algebra--the visual
expression of the mathematical idea. Approaching an understanding
of chaos through such visual means is appealing to those with
an aversion to conventional mathematics. The <i>Euclidean geometry</i>
that we learned in high school originated with the ancient Greeks
and was developed more fully by the French mathematician Descartes
and others in the 1600's. It deals with simple shapes such as
lines
circles
and spheres. Euclidean geometry is now being augmented
by <i>fractal geometry</i>
whose father and champion is the contemporary
mathematician
Benoit Mandelbrot. Fractals appeared in art
such
as in the drawings of the Dutch artist
Maurits C. Escher
before
they were widely appreciated by mathematicians and scientists.
</p><p>
Some fractals are exactly self-similar
which means that they
look the same no matter how much you magnify them. Others
such
as most of the ones in this book
only have <i>regions</i> that
are self-similar. There is no part of the Hénon attractor
where you can zoom in and find a miniature replica of the entire
attractor. Other fractals are only <i>statistically</i> self-similar

which means that a magnified portion of the object has the same
<i>amount</i> of detail as the whole
but it is not an exact replica
of it. Nearly all strange attractors are fractals
but not all
fractals arise from strange attractors.
</p><p>
The Hénon map produces an object with a <i>fractal dimension</i>
that is a fraction intermediate between one and two. The fractal
dimension is a useful quantity for characterizing strange attractors.
Isolated points have dimension zero
line segments have dimension
one
surfaces have dimension two
and solids have dimension three.
Strange attractors generally have non-integer dimensions.
</p><p>
Since the Hénon map has <i>X</i>2 as its highest-order
term
it is a <i>quadratic map</i>. The most general two-dimensional
quadratic iterated map is
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>4<i>XnYn</i> + <i>a</i>5<i>Yn</i> + <i>a</i>6<i>Yn</i>2
</p><p>
(Eq. 3B)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>7 + <i>a</i>8<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>9<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>10<i>XnYn</i> + <i>a</i>11<i>Yn</i> + <i>a</i>12<i>Yn</i>2
</p><p>
Equations 3B have twelve coefficients. For the Hénon map

<i>a</i>1 = 1
<i>a</i>3 = -1.4
<i>a</i>5 = 0.3
<i>a</i>8 =
1
and the other coefficients are zero. If we use the initial
letter E to represent two-dimensional quadratic maps
the code
for the Hénon map according to Table 2.1 is EWM?MPM2WM4

where we have introduced the shorthand M2 for MM and M4 for MMMM.
</p><p>
Values of <i>a</i> in the range of -1.2 to 1.2 are sufficient
to produce an enormous variety of strange attractors. With increments
of 0.1
there are 2512 or about 6 x 1016 different cases
of which
approximately 1.6% or about 1015 are chaotic. Viewing them all
at a rate of one per second would require over 30 million years!
Stated differently
if each one were printed on an 8 1/2 by 11-inch
sheet of paper
the collection would cover nearly the entire land
mass of the Earth.
</p><p>
Note that not all the cases are strictly distinct. For example

if you replace <i>X</i> with <i>Y</i> and <i>Y</i> with -<i>X</i>
in Equations 3B
you will produce an attractor rotated 90 degrees
counter-clockwise from the original. When you do this
be sure
to change <i>Xn</i>+1 and <i>Yn</i>+1 as well as <i>Xn</i> and
<i>Yn</i>. Thus the code EM4CMWJM3? will produce a rotated version
of the Hénon map. In the same fashion you can rotate an
attractor through 180 degrees by replacing <i>X</i> with -<i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i> with -<i>Y</i> 
and through 270 degrees by replacing
<i>X</i> with -<i>Y</i> and <i>Y</i> with <i>X</i> . Perhaps it's
easier just to rotate your computer monitor!
</p><p>
Besides rotations
there are cases that correspond to reflections.
When viewed in a mirror
the attractors have left and right reversed

but up and down remain the same. A transformation in which <i>X</i>
is replaced with -<i>X</i> will accomplish this. Thus the code
for a reflected Hénon map is ECM[MJM2CM4. In addition

the reflections can be rotated. Thus there are at least eight
so-called <i>degenerate states</i> for each attractor
corresponding
to rotations and reflections. Such symmetries and degeneracies
play an important role in science; they often reduce the amount
of work we have to do and provide relations between phenomena
that initially appear different.
</p><p>
There are additional degenerate cases corresponding to scale
changes. For example
if you replace <i>X</i> by <i>mX</i> and
<i>Y</i> by <i>nY</i> with <i>m</i> = <i>n</i>
the attractor
remains the same except it is reduced in size by a factor of <i>m</i>.
Some of the coefficients are likely to be outside the allowed
range
however. The Hénon map with <i>m</i> = <i>n</i>
= 2
can be generated with the code ERM1MPM2WM4. With <i>m</i>
not equal to <i>n</i>
the horizontal and vertical dimensions
are scaled differently
but since the computer rescales the attractor
to fit the screen
the visual result is the same.
</p><p>
These degeneracies show that there are many ways to code a particular
attractor. Although this is true
there are so many different
possible combinations of coefficients
that it is very unlikely
that two degenerate cases will be found spontaneously. Thus the
examples displayed in this chapter represent but a tiny fraction
of the possibilities
and you will be generating many other cases

almost none of which have been seen before.
</p><p>
<b>3.2  The Butterfly Effect Revisited</b>
</p><p>
Two-dimensional chaotic iterated maps also exhibit sensitivity
to initial conditions
but the situation is more complicated than
for one-dimensional maps. Imagine a collection of initial conditions
filling a small circular region of the <i>XY</i>-plane. After
one iteration
the points will have moved to a new position in
the plane
but they will now occupy an elongated region called
an <i>ellipse</i>. The circle will have contracted in one direction
and expanded in the other. With each iteration
the ellipse will
get longer and narrower
eventually stretching out into a long
filament. The orientation of the filament also changes with each
iteration
and it wraps up like a ball of taffy.
</p><p>
Thus two-dimensional chaotic maps have not a single Lyapunov
exponent
but two--a positive one corresponding to the direction
of expansion and a negative one corresponding to the direction
of contraction. The signature of chaos is that at least one of
the Lyapunov exponents is positive. Furthermore
the magnitude
of the negative exponent has to be greater than the positive one
so that initial conditions scattered throughout the basin of attraction
contract onto an attractor that occupies a negligible portion
of the plane. The area of the ellipse continually decreases even
as it stretches to an infinite length.
</p><p>
There is a proper way to calculate both of the Lyapunov exponents.
For the mathematically inclined
the procedure involves summing
the logarithms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the
linearized transformation with occasional Gram-Schmidt reorthonormalization.
This method is slightly complicated
and so we will instead devise
a simpler procedure sufficient for determining the largest Lyapunov
exponent
which is all we need to test for chaos.
</p><p>
Suppose we take two arbitrary but nearby initial conditions.
The first few iterations of the map may cause the points to get
closer together or farther apart depending upon the initial orientation
of the two points. Eventually the points will come arbitrarily
close in the direction of the contraction
but they will continue
to separate in the direction of the expansion. Thus if we wait
long enough
the rate of separation will be governed only by the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Fortunately
this usually takes just
a few iterations.
</p><p>
However
because the separation grows exponentially for a chaotic
system
the points quickly become too far apart for an accurate
estimate of the exponent. This problem can be remedied if after
each iteration the points are moved back to their original separation
along the direction of the separation. The Lyapunov exponent is
then determined by the average of the distance they must be moved
for each iteration to maintain a constant small separation. If
the two solutions are separated by a distance <i>dn</i> after
the <i>n</i>'th iteration and the separation after the next iteration
is <i>dn</i>+1
the Lyapunov exponent is determined from
</p><p>
<i>L</i> = S log2 (<i>dn</i>+1 / <i>dn</i>) / <i>N</i>       
(Eq. 3C)
</p><p>
where the sum is taken over all iterations from <i>n</i> = 0 to
<i>n</i> = <i>N</i>-1. After each iteration
the value of one
of the iterates is changed to make <i>dn</i>+1 = <i>dn</i>. For
the cases here
<i>dn</i> is taken equal to 10-6. This procedure
will also allow us to deal with maps of three and even higher
dimension in which there are more than two Lyapunov exponents.
</p><p>
<b>3.3  Searching the Plane</b>
</p><p>
We now have all the tools in hand to conduct a computer search
for attractors in two dimensions. The procedure is the same as
for one-dimensional maps except that the Lyapunov exponent calculation
is done differently and the <i>X</i> and <i>Y </i>variables are
plotted as a point in the plane after each iteration. Listing
<b>PROG06</b> shows the changes needed to accomplish such a search.

If you are an experienced programmer
you might consider writing
a screen-saver program based on <b>PROG06</b>. Such a <i>terminate-and-stay-resident</i>
(TSR) program is run once when the computer is turned on and leaves
a portion of itself in memory
constantly monitoring keyboard
and mouse activity. When there is no user activity for five minutes

say
it would blank the screen and begin displaying a succession
of unique strange attractors to prevent screen burn-in. The original
screen would be restored whenever a key is pressed or the mouse
is moved. PowerBASIC version 3.0 allows you to do this easily
by embedding the program within POPUP statements.
</p><p>
<b>3.4  The Fractal Dimension</b>
</p><p>
The previous figures differ considerably in how densely they
fill the plane. Some are very thin; others are thick. A good contrast
is provided by Figures 3-16 and 3-17. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-16.gif">Figure 3-16</a> resembles a
piece of string that has been laid down in a complicated shape
on the page
whereas <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-17.gif">Figure 3-17</a> looks like a twisted piece of
paper with many holes in it. Thus the object in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-16.gif">Figure 3-16</a> has
a fractal dimension close to 1
and the object in Figure 3-17
has a fractal dimension closer to 2.
</p><p>
It is possible to be more explicit and to calculate the fractal
dimension exactly. Consider two simple cases
one in which successive
iterates lie uniformly along a straight line that goes diagonally
across the page
and the other in which successive iterates gradually
fill the entire plane as if they were grains of pepper sprinkled
on the paper from a great height. The first case has dimension
1 and the second has dimension 2. How would we calculate the dimension

given the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> coordinates of an arbitrary collection
of such points?
</p><p>
One method would be to draw a small circle somewhere on the plane
that surrounds at least one of the points. Then draw a second
circle with the same center but with twice the radius. Now count
the number of points inside each circle. Let's say the smaller
circle encloses <i>N</i>1 points and the larger circle encloses
<i>N</i>2 points. Obviously <i>N</i>2 is greater than or equal
to <i>N</i>1
since all the points inside the inner circle are
also inside the outer circle.
</p><p>
If the points are widely separated
then <i>N</i>2 will equal
<i>N</i>1. If the points are part of a straight line
the larger
circle will on average enclose twice as many points as the smaller
circle
but if the points are part of a plane
the larger circle
will on average enclose four times as many points as the smaller
circle
since the area of a circle is proportional to the <i>square</i>
of its radius. Thus for these simple cases the dimension is given
by
</p><p>
<i>F</i> = log2 (<i>N</i>2 / <i>N</i>1)          (Eq. 3D)
</p><p>
It is hardly surprising that if you do this operation for the
cases shown in the figures
the quantity <i>F</i> is neither 0
nor 1 nor 2
but rather a fraction.
</p><p>
With real data
a number of practical considerations determine
the accuracy of the result and the amount of computation required
to obtain it:
</p><p>
1. Is a circle the best shape
or would a square
rectangle

triangle
or some other shape be better?
</p><p>
2. How large should the circle be?
</p><p>
3. Is doubling the size of the circle optimal
or would some
other factor be better?
</p><p>
4. Where should the circles be placed and how many circles are
required to obtain a representative average?
</p><p>
5. How many points are needed to produce a reliable fractal dimension?
</p><p>
Let's address each of these questions in turn.
</p><p>
There is nothing special about circles. A rectangle
triangle

or any other two-dimensional figure would suffice
since the area
scales as the square of the linear dimension in each case. However

a circle is convenient since it is easy to tell whether a given
point is in its interior by comparing the radius of the circle
with the distance of the point from its center.
</p><p>
The optimum size of the circle represents a compromise. Ideally
the circles should be invisibly small
since the dimension is
defined in the limit of infinite resolution. However
if the circles
are too small
they contain too few points to produce a statistically
meaningful result unless an unreasonably large number of iterations
is performed. We will somewhat arbitrarily take the circles to
have a radius equal to about 2% of the diagonal of the smallest
rectangle that contains the attractor.
</p><p>
Similarly
doubling the radius of the circle is arbitrary. Small
values degrade the statistics
and large values miss too much
of the fine-scale structure. We will use a value of ten
with
the smaller circle about 0.6% the size of the attractor and the
larger circle about 6% the size of the attractor. Thus in Equation
3D we will use logarithms of base 10 (log10) instead of base 2
(log2).
</p><p>
Ideally the circles should be placed uniformly or randomly over
the plane. However
if we were to do this
most of the circles
would be empty
and a very long calculation would be required
to obtain an accurate estimate of the dimension. Instead
we center
the circles on the data points themselves. In this way the circles
tend to enclose many points. However
it represents a different
type of average since it weighs more heavily the portions of the
attractor where the points are most dense. Technically
what we
are calculating is called the <i>correlation dimension</i>
since
it involves the number of points that are <i>correlated</i> with
each point in the data set. The correlation dimension is never
greater than the fractal dimension
but it tends not to be much
smaller either.
</p><p>
The correlation dimension is only one of many ways to define
the dimension of an attractor. The various methods differ in how
the regions of the attractor are weighed in the average. It is
probably the easiest method to implement
and it gives more reliable
results than the fractal dimension when the dimension of the attractor
is greater than about two. The fractal dimension is also called
the <i>capacity dimension</i>
and it is closely related to the
<i>Hausdorff-Besicovitch</i> dimension. Furthermore
the correlation
dimension is probably a more meaningful measure of the strangeness
of the attractor
since it includes information about its formation
as well as its final appearance.

The number of data points required to provide an accurate estimate
of the dimension is a question still being debated in the scientific
literature. Therefore
we will use an heuristic approach and continually
update the dimension estimate with each iteration
giving you
an opportunity to decide when it seems to have converged to a
unique value. To do this
we must modify the procedure slightly.
Rather than count the number of data points within a circle
which
would require that the calculation run to conclusion with the
coordinates of all the points saved
we will use the equivalent
method of determining the probability that two randomly chosen
points are within a certain distance of one another. To do this

the distance of each new iterate from one of its randomly chosen
predecessors is calculated. Now you see why we bothered to save
the last 500 iterates! We will exclude the most recent 20 points

since the iterates are likely to be abnormally highly correlated
with their recent predecessors. Thus with each iteration
we have
only one additional calculation to do in which we compare the
distance of the iterate to one of its randomly chosen predecessors
and increment <i>N</i>1 and <i>N</i>2 as appropriate. The listing
<b>PROG07</b> shows the changes needed to calculate and display
the fractal dimension.

At this point you might wish to examine the fractal dimension
of the various figures in this book as well as the dimension of
those you create with <b>PROG07</b>. One thing you will notice
is that the dimension of objects that resemble lines is often
less than 1.0. One reason is that the points that make up the
line are seldom uniformly distributed along its length. Remember
that the correlation dimension is usually smaller than the fractal
dimension. They are equal if the points are uniformly distributed
over the attractor. The correlation dimension of a line consisting
of a uniform distribution of points along its length would be
exactly 1.0.
</p><p>
Also note that the dimension of most attractors varies considerably
from one part of the attractor to another. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-11.gif">Figure 3-11</a> is a good
example of one in which parts of the attractor resemble thin lines
and other parts resemble filled-in planes. It is obviously simplistic
to characterize such an object by a single average dimension.
</p><p>
The dimension also depends on scale. It is properly defined in
the limit where one zooms in very tightly on the attractor to
observe its finest detail. However
a calculation in this limit
would take forever since an infinite number of iterations would
be required to collect enough points to reveal the detail. Figure
3-13 is an example of an attractor that is nearly one-dimensional
on a large scale but closer to two-dimensional on a fine scale.
Our calculation provides what might be called a <i>visual</i>
dimension
since it is taken on a scale close to what the eye
can visually resolve. In any case
you should not ascribe undue
significance to the calculated dimension.
</p><p>
Also note that we are using the word "dimension" to
mean several different things. The maps that we are looking at
are two-dimensional because they have two variables
<i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i>. However
the attractor has a smaller dimension.
We say the attractor is <i>embedded</i> in a two-dimensional space
or that the <i>embedding dimension</i> is 2. A point or a line
can be embedded in a plane
but a ball cannot.
</p><p>
An attractor usually fills a negligible portion of the space
in which it is embedded. That's why it's called an attractor!
Points initially distributed throughout the embedding space are
drawn to the attractor after a number of iterations
and the remaining
space is left empty. Thus the area of an attractor embedded in
a two-dimensional space is zero
and the volume of an attractor
embedded in a three-dimensional space is zero
and so forth.
</p><p>
It is also interesting that the fractal dimension and the Lyapunov
exponents are not entirely independent. It has been conjectured
but never completely proved that the fractal dimension is related
to the two Lyapunov exponents by
</p><p>
<i>F</i> = 1 - <i>L</i>1 / <i>L</i>2                    (Eq. 3E)
</p><p>
where <i>L</i>1 is the more positive of the two exponents and
is the one we denote by <i>L</i> in the figures. If both Lyapunov
exponents are known
Equation 3E can be used to define a dimension
of the attractor
called the <i>Lyapunov dimension</i>. The Lyapunov
dimension is also called the <i>Kaplan-Yorke dimension</i> after
the scientists who made the conjecture.
</p><p>
This relation is reasonable
since
if the two exponents are
equal but of opposite signs (<i>L</i>2 = - <i>L</i>1)
the contraction
in one direction is just offset by expansion in the other. A set
of initial conditions spread out over a two-dimensional region
thus maintains its area upon successive iteration. Such a mapping
is said to be <i>area-preserving</i> or <i>Hamiltonian</i>
after
the nineteenth century Irish astronomer
William Rowan Hamilton.
On the other hand
if the contraction is very rapid (<i>L</i>2
is large and negative)
the initial conditions quickly collapse
to a very elongated ellipse whose dimension is close to 1. Such
a contraction is sometimes called <i>filamentation</i>.
</p><p>
Armed with information about the fractal dimension
you can program
the computer to be even more selective. For example
the visually
appealing attractors tend to have fractal dimensions slightly
greater than 1
and thus you could reject those with smaller dimensions
or those with dimensions close to 2. We will return to this intriguing
possibility in Chapter 8.
</p><p>
<b>3.5  Higher Order Disorder</b>
</p><p>
With one-dimensional maps
the attractors became more interesting
when we considered terms higher than quadratic. It is straightforward
to do the same with two-dimensional maps. For example
the most
general equations for two-dimensional <i>cubic</i> maps are:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>4<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>5<i>Xn</i>2<i>Yn</i> 
</p><p>
+ <i>a</i>6<i>XnYn</i>  + <i>a</i>7<i>XnYn</i>2 + <i>a</i>8<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>9<i>Yn</i>2 + <i>a</i>10<i>Yn</i>3
</p><p>
(Eq. 3F)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>11 + <i>a</i>12<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>13<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>14<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>15<i>Xn</i>2<i>Yn</i> 
</p><p>
+ <i>a</i>16<i>XnYn</i> + <i>a</i>17<i>XnYn</i>2 + <i>a</i>18<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>19<i>Yn</i>2 + <i>a</i>20<i>Yn</i>3 
</p><p>
Note that there are twenty coefficients
which vastly increases
the number of possible cases. The fourth-order case would have
30 coefficients
and the fifth-order case would have 42 coefficients.
If you prefer an equation
a two-dimensional map of order <i>O</i>
will have (<i>O</i> + 1)(<i>O</i> + 2) coefficients. We will code
the cubic
quartic
and quintic cases with the letters F
G
and
H
respectively.

Perhaps this is a good point to pause and reiterate in what sense
these objects are attractors. If you choose initial values of
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> somewhere near the attractor
within its
basin of attraction
and substitute these values into the equations
that describe the attractor
the new values of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
will represent a point in the plane that is closer to the attractor.
After a number of iterations
the point will work its way to the
attractor
and thereafter it will move around on the attractor
in some complicated manner
eventually visiting every part of
the attractor. The next position can always be simply and accurately
predicted from the current position
but the small
inevitable
uncertainty in position continually increases so that a long-term
prediction is impossible
except to say that the point will be
somewhere on the attractor. You can think of the attractor as
the set of all possible long-term solutions of the equations that
produced it.
</p><p>
Besides the error in knowing perfectly the initial conditions

there are also computer round-off errors at each iteration. Given
the extreme sensitivity to small errors
you may wonder whether
any computer is capable of calculating correctly such a chaotic
process. It is true that if the same chaotic equations are iterated
on two computers using different precision or round-off methods

the sequence of iterates will almost certainly be completely different
after a few iterations. However
the general appearance of the
attractor will probably be the same. In such a case
we say that
the solution is <i>structurally stable</i> or <i>robust</i>. Furthermore

according to the <i>shadowing lemma</i>
an appropriate small
change in initial conditions will produce a chaotic sequence that
follows arbitrarily close to the computed one.
</p><p>
Since computers always round the results of calculations to a
finite number of digits (or more precisely
<i>bits</i>)
there
is a limited number of allowed values. Thus successive iteration
of a map will always eventually repeat a previously obtained value

whereupon the solution will reproduce exactly the same sequence
of states as it did before. Strictly speaking
every such solution
is periodic
and true chaos cannot be observed with a computer.
However
with double precision floating point variables
which
are normally 64 bits
there are 264 or about 1019 possible values.
Until the number of iterations approaches this value
there is
little cause to worry. For maps higher than one-dimensional
this
problem is even less serious
since all the variables have to
reach a previously existing state at the same time.
</p><p>
It is also interesting to realize that infinitely many periodic
solutions are embedded in each attractor. These solutions are
called periodic <i>orbits</i>. From wherever you start on the
attractor
you will eventually return to a point arbitrarily close
to the starting point. This result is called the <i>Poincaré
recurrence theorem</i>
after Jules-Henri Poincaré
a French
mathematician
who
a hundred years ago
portended the modern
era of chaos. Thus by making only a small change in the starting
point
it is possible
in principle
to return exactly to the
starting point
which implies a periodic orbit with a period equal
to the number of iterations required to return. Most of these
orbits have very large periods
however.
</p><p>
Every point on the attractor is arbitrarily close to such a periodic
orbit
but the chance that a randomly chosen point on the attractor
lies on such an orbit is infinitesimal. We say that the periodic
orbits are <i>dense</i> on the attractor. These orbits
though
infinite in number
constitute a Cantor set of measure zero. The
periodic orbits are unstable in the sense that if you get just
slightly off the orbit
you will continue to get farther away
with each iteration.
</p><p>
The strange attractors exhibited in this book are examples of
<i>orbital fractals</i>. They should be distinguished from <i>escape-time
fractals</i>
which show the basin of attraction and typically
display with color the number of iterations required for points
outside the basin to escape beyond some pre-defined region. The
<i>Mandelbrot</i> and <i>Julia</i> sets are perhaps the best-known
escape-time fractals. Escape-time fractals require much longer
computing times to develop but provide dazzling displays with
exotic fine-scale structure.
</p><p>
<b>3.6  Strange Attractor Planets</b>
</p><p>
The previous figures have obvious beauty
but they generally
lack symmetry. Nature mixes symmetry with disorder
and our sense
of beauty has developed accordingly. The Earth viewed from outer
space is beautiful in part because the irregular features of the
clouds and continents are superimposed on a nearly perfect sphere.
</p><p>
There are many ways to do the same with our attractors. Suppose

for example
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are not the horizontal and
vertical position in a plane
but rather the longitude and latitude
on the surface of the Earth. The result is an object that might
resemble a strange planet with swirling clouds
oceans
canals

craters
and other features.
</p><p>
Note that mapping a plane onto a sphere is a nonlinear transformation.
You can't wrap a piece of paper around a globe without a large
non-uniform stretching. That's why Greenland looks larger than
South America on most flat maps. When a sphere is projected onto
a flat computer screen or onto the page of a book
it is stretched
so as to magnify the central portion of the attractor and compress
the edges.
</p><p>
If q is the longitude (measured from zero at the right edge)
and f is the latitude (measured from zero at the top)
the <i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i> coordinates of the projection of a sphere onto the
screen are given by
</p><p>
<i>Xp</i> = cos q sin f
</p><p>
(Eq. 3G)
</p><p>
<i>Yp</i> = cos f
</p><p>
We get q from <i>X</i> by a scaling that keeps q in the range
of 0 to p radians (180 degrees)
since there is no need to plot
points that lie on the back side of the planet. Similarly we get
f from <i>Y</i> by a scaling that keeps f in the range of 0 (at
the North Pole) to p radians (at the South Pole). The program
modifications required to accomplish this transformation are given
in the listing <b>PROG09</b>. The program allows you to toggle
back and forth between the two types of projection by pressing
the <b>P</b> key.

Figures 3-42 through 3-57 show some examples of two-dimensional
attractors projected onto a sphere. Note that the features on
the attractors tend to converge at the poles at the top and bottom
of the figures. This convergence could be suppressed by using
an area-preserving transformation that stretches the <i>Y</i>-values
near the poles by the same factor that the <i>X</i>-values are
compressed. This simplest way to produce this effect is just to
delete line 4140.</p><hr>

If you are using PowerBASIC or its predecessor
TurboBASIC
and
VGA graphics you will note a slight incompatibility with the CIRCLE
command that causes the size of the circle that surrounds the
attractor to vary from case to case. In these dialects of BASIC

the radius of the circle in SCREEN modes 11 and 12 is specified
in units of the screen height rather than its width. If you encounter
this problem
try replacing the .36 * (<i>XH</i> - <i>XL</i>)
in line 3320 with .5 * (<i>YH</i> - <i>YL</i>).
</p><p>
Planes and spheres are not the only two-dimensional surfaces
onto which attractors can be projected. A cylinder is another
possibility. The cylinder can be oriented with its axis either
horizontal or vertical
or tilted at some arbitrary angle. A torus
is another possibility. You may be able to think of other more
exotic surfaces onto which the attractors can be projected.
</p><p>
<b>3.7  Designer Plaids</b>
</p><p>
It is interesting that all the one-dimensional maps described
in the previous chapter are included in the two-dimensional cases.
One needs only to set the coefficients of the <i>Y</i>-equation
to zero. For example
a two-dimensional map equivalent to the
logistic equation is given by the code EMu%M9. However
since
<i>Y</i> doesn't change with successive iterations
a graph of
<i>Y</i> versus <i>X</i> is simply a straight
horizontal line.
</p><p>
To display the logistic parabola
we need to replace <i>X</i>
with the next iterate of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> with the <i>second</i>
next iterate of <i>X</i>. Two successive iterations of a quadratic
map requires a fourth-order equation. A code that will accomplish
this is GMu%M13NHUIM10.
</p><p>
There are other examples of two-dimensional maps that are really
one-dimensional maps in disguise. Suppose <i>Xn</i>+1 depends
only on <i>Yn</i> and <i>Yn</i>+1 depends only on <i>Xn</i>. Then
<i>Xn</i>+2 will depend only on <i>Xn</i>
and we have a one-dimensional
map for <i>X</i> in which <i>Y</i> is merely an intermediate value
of <i>X</i>. The most general fifth-order polynomial example of
such a case is
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>17<i>Yn</i> + <i>a</i>18<i>Yn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>19<i>Yn</i>3 + <i>a</i>20<i>Yn</i>4 + <i>a</i>21<i>Yn</i>5
</p><p>
(Eq. 3H)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>22 + <i>a</i>23<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>24<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>25<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>26<i>Xn</i>4 + <i>a</i>27<i>Xn</i>5
</p><p>
This case can be achieved by setting the remaining thirty coefficients
to zero in <b>PROG09</b> by adding the following line after line
2730:
</p><p>
2735    IF (<i>I%</i> &gt; 1 AND <i>I%</i> &lt; <i>M%</i> / 2
- <i>O%</i>) OR <i>I%</i> &gt; <i>M%</i> / 2 + <i>O%</i> + 1 THEN
MID$(<i>CODE$</i>
<i>I%</i> + 1
1) = "M"
</p><p>
The result is to produce a 25th-order
one-dimensional
polynomial
map
displayed in two dimensions.
</p><p>
Figures 3-58 through 3-62 show sample attractors obtained in
this way. Notice that they fill in rectangular regions resembling
a plaid tartan
in sharp contrast to all the previous cases. These
attractors are especially appropriate for projecting onto a sphere
since the features line up east-west along parallels and north-south
along meridians. Figures 3-63 and 3-64 show some examples of plaid
planetary attractors.</p><hr>

You might wish to try adding colors to emulate a decorative cloth
pattern. On way to do this is to color the pixels according to
the number of times they are visited by the orbit. This is easily
done by changing line 2300 in the program to
</p><p>
2300    PSET (<i>XP</i>
<i>YP</i>)
(POINT (<i>XP</i>
<i>YP</i>)
+ 1) MOD 16
</p><p>
which causes the color of the existing point at (<i>XP</i>
<i>YP</i>)
to be tested and then plotted with the next color in the palette
of 16 colors. In the next chapter
we will discuss other ways
to produce colorful attractors.
</p><p>
<b>3.8  Strange Attractors that Don't</b>
</p><p>
From the foregoing discussion
you might conclude that all chaotic
equations produce strange attractors. Such is not the case. Under
certain conditions
the successive iterates of an equation will
wander chaotically throughout a region of the plane. There is
no basin of attraction
and initial conditions near but outside
the chaotic region are not drawn to the region but rather lie
on closed curves. Although the chaotic region is not a strange
attractor
it may have considerable beauty.
</p><p>
For a chaotic solution not to attract
the area occupied by a
cluster of nearby initial conditions must remain the same with
successive iterations. The cluster will generally contract in
one direction and expand in the other
but the contraction and
expansion just cancel
producing a long
thin filament of constant
area. A characteristic of such a case is that the two Lyapunov
exponents are equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. Such a
system is said to be <i>area-preserving</i> or <i>Hamiltonian</i>.
</p><p>
You might think that Hamiltonian systems are relatively rare
in nature
since they require a special condition. However
there
are many important examples of Hamiltonian chaos. They arise because
there are quantities in nature such as energy and angular momentum
that
in the absence of friction
remain accurately constant no
matter how complicated the behavior of the system. We say these
quantities are <i>conserved</i> or that they are <i>constants
of the motion</i>. The motion of a planet orbiting a binary-star
system or the motion of an electron near the null in a magnetic
field exhibit Hamiltonian chaos. A more familiar example is the
filamentation of milk when it is stirred into coffee
in which
case the volume of the milk is conserved because liquids are nearly
incompressible.
</p><p>
With equations such as those we have been using with randomly
chosen coefficients
the chance of inadvertently finding an area-preserving
solution is essentially zero. However
by placing appropriate
conditions on the coefficients
we can guarantee such solutions.
An example of an area-preserving
two-dimensional polynomial map
is the following:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2
+ <i>a</i>4<i>Xn</i>3 + <i>a</i>5<i>Xn</i>4 + <i>a</i>6<i>Xn</i>5
± <i>Yn</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 3I)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>22 ± <i>Xn</i>
</p><p>
This map is fifth-order to provide seven arbitrary coefficients
that ensure a large number of solutions. The coefficient labels
are consistent with the general
two-dimensional
fifth-order
map
in which 33 of the coefficients have been set to zero. The
two terms preceded with ± (<i>a</i>17 and <i>a</i>23) have
coefficients of either +1 or -1
and this feature guarantees an
area-preserving solution. If the signs are the same (both plus
or both minus)
chaotic solutions are not found. Hamiltonian chaos
can occur when the signs are opposite. The negative product of
these two coefficients is the <i>Jacobian</i> of the map (<i>J</i>
= -<i>a</i>17<i>a</i>23). The Jacobian is a measure of the net
contraction
and it must equal 1.0 for a Hamiltonian system.
</p><p>
Hamiltonian cases can be produced by adding to <b>PROG09</b>
after line 2730 the following lines:
</p><p>
2735    IF <i>I%</i> &gt; <i>O%</i> + 1 AND <i>I%</i> &lt;&gt;
<i>M%</i> / 2 + 1 THEN MID$(<i>CODE$</i>
<i>I%</i> + 1
1) =
"M"
</p><p>
2736    MID$(<i>CODE$</i>
<i>M%</i> / 2 - <i>O%</i> + 2
1) =
"W": MID$(<i>CODE$</i>
<i>M%</i> / 2 + 3
1) = "C"
</p><p>
Sample Hamiltonian chaotic solutions are shown in Figures 3-64
through 3-71. Most of the cases resemble chains of islands in
which each island contains a fixed point surrounded by closed
contours that are not shown. These cases were produced using initial
values of <i>X</i> = <i>Y</i> = 0.05. Other initial conditions
would produce completely different pictures since there is no
attractor.</p><hr>

Hamiltonian cases have a different look from non-Hamiltonian
strange attractors. The difference is even more pronounced if
you watch while they develop on the computer screen. Whereas the
regions of a strange attractor tend to be visited uniformly and
apparently randomly
the Hamiltonian cases develop much more slowly.
The points often wander over a small region for tens of thousands
of iterations
and then they will suddenly begin to fill in a
new distinct region that had never been visited before. Consequently

many more iterations are required to determine the stability and
chaotic nature of the solution. You need to be patient while the
computer calculates.
</p><p>
The different time behavior of these cases raises an important
issue. When you view any of the figures in this book
you are
seeing a <i>static</i> object. However
it was produced by a <i>dynamic</i>
process. Information about the sequence in which the points accumulated
has been lost. This additional information is recovered when you
watch the attractors develop on your computer screen. Most of
the attractors fill in uniformly. The contrast gets progressively
greater
much as a photographic print being developed.
</p><p>
However
the Hamiltonian cases develop more slowly and in stages.
If your computer has a color monitor
you might try exhibiting
this sequence by plotting the points in color and changing the
color every few thousand iterations. Some examples using this
technique will be shown in Section 7.5. If you try this for the
non-Hamiltonian attractors
the colors overlap and merge into
a uniform gray
or you just see the most recent color. For the
Hamiltonian cases
beautiful color patterns can be produced. Otherwise

continue on to the next chapter where various color techniques
will be discussed.
</p><p>
<b>3.9  A New Dimension in Sound</b>
</p><p>
With one-dimensional maps
we tried to make music by letting
successive iterates control the pitch of the musical notes
all
of which were of the same duration. The same procedure can be
used with two-dimensional maps. However
we have a second variable
at our disposal
and so let's use it to control the duration of
each note. With actual music
it turns out that there are many
more notes of short duration than of long duration. There are
roughly twice as many half notes as whole notes
and twice as
many quarter notes as half notes
and so forth. This remarkable
result seems to hold for all types of music from different composers
and cultures. It is evidence of hidden determinism in music.
</p><p>
The program modification <b>PROG10</b> uses the <i>X</i>-value
to control the pitch and the <i>Y</i>-value to control the duration
of the notes. For convenience
we assume that the longest note
is a whole note and the shortest note is a sixteenth note. Dotted
notes and rests are not allowed.
</p><p>
The listing <b>PROG10</b> also adds to the program a menu screen
that reminds you of the <b>S</b> command
which toggles the sound
on and off
and the <b>P</b> command
which toggles the projection
between planar and spherical. We also introduce an <b>A</b> command
to initiate the search for attractors
a <b>D</b> command to toggle
between one-dimensional and two-dimensional maps
an <b>I</b>
command to let you input the code of an attractor that you know

and an <b>X</b> command to exit the program. Pressing any other
key will display the menu screen.

As you listen to the music produced by the various attractors

you may discover relations between the quality of the music and
the appearance of the attractor. The cases that seem most musical
tend to have certain visual characteristics
which will be left
for you to discover. Do attractors that appeal to the eye also
appeal to the ear?
</p><p>
After you have generated some music of your own
you may wish
to try some of the cases in Table 3.1 using the <b>I</b> command
to input them to the program. They have been selected for their
musical quality and are limited to quadratic maps to simplify
typing their codes. An interesting study would be to accumulate
your own longer list of musical attractors and to see if they
preferentially have certain fractal dimensions and Lyapunov exponents.
If so
then it should be possible to program the computer to be
a music critic as well as an art critic.

After listening to the enormous variety of musical sequences
that can be generated by this technique
you might wonder whether
your favorite musical composition could be compressed into a short
code and generated using iterated maps. After all
even for the
simple cases in the table above
there are about 6 x 1016 different
codes
and each code corresponds to a different piece of music.
</p><p>
However
a typical musical piece might have hundreds or thousands
of notes
each of which can represent dozens of pitches and many
durations. Thus we can be fairly confident using the principles
of <i>information theory</i> that such extreme compression is
unlikely unless there is considerably more structure to music
than is apparent. However
if you only want to generate a short
tune with a few notes
there might well be a way to do so using
this technique. If you are mathematically inclined
take it as
a challenge to find a way to do this.
</p><p>
The generation of computer music using chaotic iterated maps
is a promising technique still in its infancy. You may wish to
incorporate more sophisticated musical rules into the program
to generate music that is much more pleasing than what results
from this simple procedure. Furthermore
an interesting project
would be to turn the process around and see if music written by
humans resembles a strange attractor
and if so
to measure its
fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent. Perhaps music of different
types or by different composers would have different values of
these quantities.
</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 4</b>
</p><p>
<b>Attractors of Depth</b>
</p><p>
A two-dimensional world is a mere shadow of reality. The techniques
described in the previous chapters are easily extended to produce
attractors embedded in the three-dimensional space in which we
live. The challenge is in finding ways to exhibit and visualize
such three-dimensional objects within the limitations of the computer
screen and printed page. This chapter will emphasize new visualization
techniques and will provide many new examples of strange attractors
that have depth as well as width and height.
</p><p>
<b>4.1  Projections</b>
</p><p>
The procedure for seeking attractors in three dimensions (which
we might whimsically call <i>strange attractors of the third kind</i>)
is just like the two-dimensional case
except that we introduce
a third variable <i>Z</i> to accompany <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.
You can think of <i>Z</i> as representing the position in a direction
out of the screen or page on which the attractor is displayed.
We will take the direction of positive <i>Z</i> to be out of the
page and negative <i>Z</i> to be behind the page as is customary
for a conventional <i>right-handed coordinate system</i>. The
term <i>right-handed</i> comes from the convention that if you
point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the <i>X</i>-axis
and curl them so that they point along the <i>Y</i>-axis
your
thumb will point in the <i>Z</i>-direction. This choice is purely
arbitrary but is widely accepted.
</p><p>
The simplest system of equations that produces strange attractors
embedded in a three-dimensional space is a set of coupled quadratic
equations
the most general form of which is given by
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Xn</i>2

These equations have thirty coefficients
which allow an enormous
variety of attractors. The extension to equations with order higher
than two is straightforward. Three-dimensional cubic equations
have sixty coefficients
quartic equations have 105 coefficients

and quintic equations have 168 coefficients. The number of coefficients
for order <i>O</i> is given by (<i>O</i> + 1)(<i>O</i> + 2)(<i>O</i>
+ 3) / 2. We will code the second-order through fifth-order systems
in three dimensions with the initial letters I
J
K
and L
respectively.
</p><p>
Note that 168 coefficients allows 25168 or about 10234 combinations.
This is a truly astronomical number. Even if only a small fraction
of them correspond to distinct strange attractors
their number
enormously exceeds the number of electrons
protons
and neutrons
in the entire universe! This number is a mere 1079. Thus the number
of fifth-order
three-dimensional strange attractors is essentially
infinite. You can have a large collection of your own
none of
which are likely to be reproduced by anyone else unless you give
them the code you used to produce them. The code is like a combination
lock with 168 settings that must all be entered correctly and
in the proper order.
</p><p>
Now we must confront the issue of how best to display an object
composed of points in a three-dimensional space. Such problems
are in the domain of a new specialty called <i>visualization</i>

which we may define as the use of computer imagery to gain insight
into complex phenomena. The need for improved visualization techniques
has emerged from the rapidly growing use of computers as the primary
tool for scientific calculation and modeling. As computers become
more powerful
it is increasingly important to devise methods
of dealing with large quantities of data. The eye and brain are
very efficient at discerning visual patterns
and these patterns
permit an intuitive understanding of complicated processes in
a way that equations often cannot. Scientists have recently developed
impressive visualization techniques
simple versions of which
are presented here.
</p><p>
The simplest method is to ignore one of the coordinates and to
plot the points in the remaining two dimensions. This method is
equivalent to looking at the shadow cast by the object when illuminated
from directly above by a point-source of light a large distance
away. If the light source is on the <i>Z</i>-axis
we say the
attractor is <i>projected</i> onto the <i>XY</i>-plane. The screen
used in conjunction with a slide projector is such a plane. Of
course
considerable information about the attractor is lost in
such a projection
but the method is a convenient starting point

and it is simple to program.
</p><p>
The listing <b>PROG11</b> provides the changes that must be made
in the program <b>PROG10</b> to extend the attractor search to
three dimensions with order up to five. Since the search slows
down considerably in three dimensions with such a large number
of coefficients
especially if you don't have a compiled version
of BASIC and a fast computer
the program saves
for each case
found
the code
fractal dimension
and Lyapunov exponent in a
disk file with the name <b>SA.DIC</b> (<b>S</b>trange <b>A</b>ttractor
<b>Dic</b>tionary). This feature allows you to run the program
unattended and to collect the attractors it finds. We will later
modify the program to let you examine the cases that you collect.

Some examples of the attractors produced by <b>PROG11</b> are
shown in Figures 4-1 through 4-16. Note that the fractal dimension
shown for each case is the dimension of the actual attractor and
not the dimension of its projection. Thus the fractal dimension
can be as large as 3 even though the projection has dimension
of at most 2. The projection of a point (zero dimensions) onto
a surface is a point
the projection of a line (one dimension)
is a line
the projection of a surface (two dimensions) is a surface

but the projection of a solid (three dimensions) onto a surface
is only a surface (two dimensions).</p><hr>

<b> </b>On the whole
attractors in three dimensions projected
onto a plane are not particularly different or better than the
two-dimensional examples of the previous chapter. Ones with high
fractal dimensions (near and above 2) tend to be uninteresting
when projected onto two dimensions because they are too filled-in.
Note also that all the two-dimensional cases are included as special
cases of the three-dimensional ones and that they can be recovered
by setting the appropriate coefficients to zero. For example

the Hénon map can be reproduced in three dimensions using
the code IWM?M2PM5WM18. You may wish to try entering this case
into the program using the <b>I</b> command. Be sure to count
the number of M's very carefully and to use capital letters.
</p><p>
The attractors displayed in the previous figures are projected
onto the <i>XY</i>-plane. They could equally well be projected
onto the <i>YZ</i> or <i>ZX</i>-plane. With a bit more effort
it would be possible to project them onto a plane inclined at
an arbitrary angle. Attractors are most visually appealing when
viewed from a particular direction. The formulas that transform
a point with coordinates (<i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
<i>Z</i>) into a
two-dimensional projection (<i>Xp</i>
<i>Yp</i>) with viewing
angles (q
f) in spherical coordinates are
</p><p>
<i>Xp</i> = - <i>X</i> sin q + <i>Y</i> cos q
</p><p>
(Eq. 4B)
</p><p>
<i>Yp</i> = - <i>X</i> sin q cos f - <i>Y</i> sin q cos f + <i>Z</i>
sin f
</p><p>
With a sufficiently powerful computer
you could rotate the attractor
to produce an animated display. You may wish to experiment with
these ideas.
</p><p>
There are a number of ways to modify the program to change the
orientation of the projection. The simplest (though not very practical)
way is just to wait until the search turns up the same attractor
viewed from a different angle. Note in Equation 4A
for example

that if you interchange the coefficients in an appropriate way

the result is to replace <i>X</i> with <i>Y</i>
<i>Y</i> with
<i>Z</i>
and <i>Z</i> with <i>X</i>. If the attractor code were
IABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^
the code IKPQRNSTOLMUZ[\X]^YVWAFGHDIJEBC
would produce a projection of the same attractor onto the <i>YZ</i>-plane

and the code IU]^Y\VWXZ[AIJEHBCDFGKSTORLMNPQ would produce a projection
of the attractor onto the <i>ZX</i>-plane. Figures 4-17 and 4-18
show the result of applying these transformations to the attractor
in Figure 4-4.</p><hr>

4.2  Shadows
</p><p>
In the previous figures
the attractors were projected as if
illuminated from directly along the line of sight. Now suppose
the point source of illumination is moved slightly off to one
side and that you observe the attractor against a background screen.
Each point making up the attractor appears as a dot of reflected
light above the background plane and produces a shadow point opposite
the illumination a distance proportional to the position of the
point above the plane. For this purpose
we assume the most distant
point of the attractor is touching the screen and the nearest
point is out of the screen a distance equal to its width. We'll
assume it is illuminated from above your left shoulder so that
the shadow is below and to the right
in keeping with the Microsoft
style guidelines as exhibited in recent versions of Windows.
</p><p>
To produce a shadow
we need a background shade of gray intermediate
between the black and white that we have been using so far. If
your computer has at least EGA graphics
this poses no difficulty.
There are two grays
COLOR 8
which is 25% illuminated
and COLOR
7
which is 75% illuminated. We'll use COLOR 8
which is the darker
of the two. For convenience
Table 4.1 lists the sixteen default
colors provided with SCREEN modes 7 through 13.
</p><p>
<b>Table 4.1  Default EGA and VGA colors for SCREEN modes 7 to
13</b></p><hr>
Number Color Number Color<hr>
0 Black 8 Gray1 Blue 9 Bright blue2 Green 10 Bright green3 Cyan
11 Bright cyan4 Red 12 Bright red5 Magenta 13 Bright magenta6
Brown 14 Yellow7 White 15 Bright white
<p>
If you have CGA graphics
you might try plotting the points in
white (COLOR 3) and their shadow in black (COLOR 0) on a magenta
(COLOR 2) background using SCREEN 1 (320 by 200 resolution) and
PALETTE 1. In any case
it may help to adjust the intensity control
on the monitor for an easily visible shadow.
</p><p>
Since we have another shade of gray available
we can use it
to control the brightness of the points plotted. The first time
a screen pixel is illuminated by a point on the attractor
we
will use low intensity white (COLOR 7)
and subsequent times we
will use high intensity white (COLOR 15). If your computer has
a monochrome graphics monitor that maps the other colors to various
shades of gray
you can extend this technique to provide additional
gray levels
producing an attractor whose brightness corresponds
to the frequency its various regions are visited. This trick helps
to compensate for the limited spatial resolution of the computer
screen.
</p><p>
It also helps to draw a grid on the background to make it more
obvious that the attractor is sitting above the screen. The grid
is drawn in black (COLOR 0)
the same as the shadow.
</p><p>
If your computer has at least EGA capability
the program <b>PROG12</b>
will produce the desired shadow display. It allows you to toggle
between projections and shadows by pressing the <b>R</b> key.

The angle of illumination is determined by the .05 in line 3430.
You might try different values. The value of .05 is the tangent
of both the horizontal and vertical angle that the source of illumination
makes with the perpendicular to the plane. The angle is about
3 degrees toward the left and 3 degrees toward the top of the
figure. Sample attractors produced by <b>PROG12</b> are shown
in Figures 4-19 through 4-34.</p><hr>

If you look closely at the figures with shadows
you will note
that it is hard to tell whether one portion of the attractor lies
above or below another portion. The reason for this is that we
have not allowed the closer portion of the attractor to cast a
shadow on the more distant portion. To do so requires a complicated
program
which will be left as a challenge for you.
</p><p>
If you attempt to improve the shadow display in this way
you
will need to store in an array the largest <i>Z</i>-value corresponding
to each screen pixel. With VGA (640 by 480)
you will need 600
K bytes even if you convert the <i>Z</i>-values into integers.
Most versions of BASIC limit the size of arrays to 64 K bytes

and the disk operating system usually limits the total program
size to about 600 K bytes. Thus you will probably have to use
a lower screen resolution or devise a more compact coding scheme.
For example
if you use only 16 values of <i>Z</i>
you can store
two screen pixels per byte
which is four times better than storing
the <i>Z</i>-value of each pixel as a two-byte integer. Alternately

you might store the <i>Z</i>-values of only those pixels that
are illuminated
but then you will need to devise a quick way
to locate the proper element in the array corresponding to each
pair of screen coordinates.
</p><p>
Before each point on the attractor is plotted
it is necessary
to be sure it doesn't fall in the shadow of a previously plotted
point. If it doesn't
then it can be plotted
but then you have
to determine whether it occludes any previously plotted point.
Alternately
you can first plot all the points and then scan the
image starting from the side toward the illumination
blocking
out any points that fall in the shadow of another point.
</p><p>
<b>4.3  Bands</b>
</p><p>
Another way to display the third dimension is with elevation
contours such as those found on topographic maps. With enough
points
you could plot only those that have specific values of
<i>Z</i>. Of course the chance that a point has any particular
exact value of <i>Z</i> is negligibly small
and so the points
would accumulate on the screen very slowly. To make the method
work
you have to plot all the points that lie within bands centered
on the desired values.
</p><p>
You have freedom to choose the width of the bands. With narrow
bands
the contours resemble distinct lines
but they form very
slowly. With wide bands
the gaps between the bands are hard to
see. By making the bands half as wide as the spacing between the
contours
the bright and dark spaces are equal in width
and they
form rapidly and are easy to see.
</p><p>
You also need to decide how many contours to use. You need at
least several to make the method work
but if you use too many

they begin to run together at modest screen resolution and number
of iterations. For the cases shown here
we use fifteen bands
as a reasonable compromise.
</p><p>
Since we used a four-level gray scale to produce the shadows
in the previous displays
we will also use it here to give the
bands a softer shading. Of course
this requires a computer with
at least EGA graphics. If your computer has CGA graphics
you
will only see two shades (black and white) with 30 bands in SCREEN
mode 2.

<b>4.4  Colors</b>
</p><p>
It's not hard to guess that the next logical step is to use the
full array of colors available on a computer with a color monitor.
In SCREEN mode 9 (EGA) and SCREEN mode 12 (VGA)
sixteen colors
can be displayed simultaneously from a palette of 64 (EGA) or
262
144 (VGA). SCREEN mode 13 (VGA)
which is supported by some
BASIC versions
allows 256 colors
but the screen resolution of
320 by 200 is inadequate for our purposes
and thus it will not
be used. In SCREEN mode 1 (CGA) only four colors can be displayed
from one of two palettes. We will assume the computer has EGA
or VGA capabilities
but the program will also work with CGA if
you use <i>SM%</i> = 1 in line 1030. The program is written to
simplify extending the technique to future new graphics modes
with more colors and higher resolution
provided they are supported
by your BASIC compiler.
</p><p>
We will convert the <i>Z</i>-values into fifteen different colors
(COLOR 1 through COLOR 15). The sixteenth (COLOR 0) is the background
color and will not be used. The default values of the colors are
given in Table 4.1. The changes required to the program are shown
in the listing <b>PROG14</b>.

<p>
Some sample color attractors produced by the program <b>PROG14</b>
are shown in Plates 1 through 8. Some of these examples are projected
onto a sphere. Note that the interposition of dots of different
colors in some of the figures gives the impression that there
are many more than sixteen colors. The addition of color usually
enhances the appearance of the attractors. More such cases could
have been included in this book
but then its cost would have
been considerably higher. You will probably henceforth want to
view your three-dimensional attractors in color.
</p><p>
You will note that where one part of the attractor lies behind
another
you can see the more distant portion through the closer
portion. Thus the attractor appears transparent
which enables
you to see its interior but tends to diminish the perception of
depth. You might wish to modify the program so that the closer
portion occludes the region behind it. It is relatively easy to
do so using the BASIC POINT function to test the existing color
of the pixel before plotting the new point and plotting it only
if its color is higher in the sequence than the existing one.
Thus each pixel will eventually be colored according to the closest
part of the attractor. This effect can be accomplished by changing
line 5160 of the program <b>PROG14</b> to
</p><p>
5160 IF <i>TRD%</i> = 3 THEN <i>C%</i> = INT(<i>NC%</i> * (<i>Z</i>
- <i>ZMIN</i>) / (<i>ZMAX</i> - <i>ZMIN</i>) + <i>NC%</i>) MOD
<i>NC%</i>: IF POINT(<i>XP</i>
<i>YP</i>) &lt; <i>C%</i> THEN
PSET (<i>XP</i>
<i>YP</i>)
<i>C%</i>
</p><p>
You can also alter the sequence of colors by changing the values
stored in the array <i>COLR%</i> in line 5630. For example
a
sequence that mimics the rainbow would advance from red (12) through
yellow (14)
green (10)
cyan (11)
and blue (9) to magenta (13).
With <i>aerial perspective</i>
brilliant
warm colors such as
red appear closer to the viewer than lighter
less brilliant

cool colors such as blue
which we associate with the distant
sky. Thus assigning red to the large <i>Z</i>-values and blue
to the small <i>Z</i>-values enhances the illusion of depth.
</p><p>
Most dialects of BASIC include a PALETTE command that allows
you to change the screen colors without replotting the data
but
this command works differently with different versions of BASIC
and in different graphics modes
and so we will not try to provide
a program that takes advantage of it. However
a challenging programming
exercise is to add the capability of rotating the color palette
by pressing a key while a color attractor is being displayed to
produce a psychedelic animated display. You might use the + key
to rotate in one direction and the - key to rotate in the opposite
direction. For most of the figures in this book
the PALETTE command
was used to interchange black and white before printing them to
save ink and to improve the appearance of the attractors when
they are displayed on a white background.
</p><p>
You may also wish to experiment with combining the various display
techniques. Clearly there is nothing to preclude displaying a
color attractor with shadows and contour bands. Such combinations
offer interesting possibilities that will be exploited for the
four-dimensional cases in the next chapter.
</p><p>
<b>4.5  Characters</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>Many computer monitors
and especially printers
lack
the capability of displaying colors. However
it is often possible
to produce a similar effect using a gray scale. In some cases

the various colors are mapped automatically into a shade of gray.
Another technique that will work on almost any computer
and that
offers interesting display possibilities
is to map the <i>Z</i>-values
into different ASCII characters and print them as a block of text.
Such text files are easily manipulated by word processors
transported
to different computers
displayed on almost any monitor
and printed
with any printer on paper of various sizes.
</p><p>
Perhaps the simplest method is to map the Z-values into consecutive
ASCII characters
thereby producing a type of gray scale with
bands whose darkness depends on the density of the character.
A more reasonable approach is to order the characters so that
the more dense ones correspond to larger values of <i>Z</i>. The
ordering depends on the font
typeface
and size of the characters.
For example
14-point Courier bold can be ordered as shown in
Table 4.2. The table uses thirty-two characters
which is about
the maximum for this technique since many of the characters have
the same density. The eye can distinguish about 500 levels of
gray. This sequence is only one of many that are equally good.
To see the gray scale
you should view the table from at least
six feet away. Squinting and removing your glasses
if you wear
them
might also help.

The character densities for this table were determined by writing
each of the ASCII characters from 33 to 127 (see Table 2.1) to
the screen of a Macintosh computer and then counting the illuminated
pixels using the POINT command in BASIC. Bold characters are chosen
for their increased density. Avoid lower-case characters where
possible since they often don't extend the full height and thus
leave a wide blank band between their top and the bottom of the
row above. Be sure to use a monospaced font
rather than a proportional
one. For the default font on most IBM computers in VGA mode SCREEN
12
a better sequence is:
</p><p>
<b>.-
;=+&gt;i%lI?v7zuCjTFSVGAEUDHBWQ</b>
</p><p>
We will not develop a computer program for implementing this
technique because the resolution is too poor for useful display
on a computer screen or page of a book. Furthermore
the program
would be dependent on the fonts available
and the capabilities
of the printer. The programming is not difficult and closely parallels
the example in <b>PROG14</b>.
</p><p>
However
Table 4.3 provides an indication of what is possible
using 7-point Courier bold characters with 78 lines of 103 characters
each. The character sequence ordered by density for this case
is given in Table 4.2. This case is a three-dimensional quadratic
map with a code of ILRRHAEYWNTPWFLHTCSLYLFAKQITQTW.
</p><p>
At such a low resolution
much of the detail is lost. However

if you have a printer or plotter capable of printing small fonts
on a large piece of paper
you will be able to recover the resolution
and produce figures of considerable artistic quality. You can
divide the text into many segments on separate pages and tape
them together or print them on a paper roll or fanfold paper to
make a very skinny attractor many feet long. With ordinary objects
such as the text in this book
extreme stretching in one dimension
just produces stick-like figures. However
strange attractors
are fractals
and they have detail on all scales
which ensures
that they look interesting however much they are stretched.

<b>4.6  Anaglyphs</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>An alternate approach for displaying objects in three
dimensions is the binocular stereogram in which the parallax produced
by separate images in each eye creates the illusion of depth.
The idea dates back to Socrates in the fourth century BC
and
the earliest stereograms were produced in the mid-1800's by Sir
Charles Wheatstone and Sir David Brewster. The inception of motion
pictures in the early 1900's was accompanied by 3-D movies using
overlapping red-green images that were viewed through red-green
glasses to produce a black-and-white image in what is called the
<i>anaglyphic</i> process. Anaglyphs have also been widely used
in comic books. Color 3-D movies using cross-Polaroid glasses
were briefly popular in the 1950's. They require a special screen
to reflect the polarized light from the projectors without allowing
it to depolarize.
</p><p>
The anaglyphic process offers distinct advantages in computer
visualization. The hardware requirements are minimal (a color
monitor and a pair of 50-cent glasses)
the programming is surprisingly
simple
and the results can be impressive. The main drawback is
that the images produced are usually monochromatic
although a
gray scale and some limited coloration are possible.
</p><p>
Our perception of depth arises from a number of psychological
and physiological processes. Many of these processes are induced
by visual cues that don't depend on binocular vision such as the
relative size and motion of objects
interposition
illumination

shadows
and focal accommodation. Others require the parallax
attendant to stereoscopic vision. When some of the usual visual
cues are absent or contradictory
a rivalry ensues that demands
time and mental effort for our brains to resolve. It is remarkable
that
with just the single cue of binocular stereopsis
most people
can quickly perceive a vivid three-dimensional image.
</p><p>
Consider a point at a distance <i>D</i> from the midpoint of
your eyes whose separation we take to be <i>e</i> (typically 6.5
cm) as shown in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig4-51.gif">Figure 4-51</a> (a). Assume the point is a single
illuminated pixel on the computer screen. Each eye must swivel
inward through an angle q in order for the two images to fuse
into a single point
where q is the angle whose tangent is <i>e</i>
/ 2<i>D</i>. It is this muscular response of the eyes that provides
the brain with the relevant depth information.</p><hr>

</p><p>
<b><a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig4-51.gif">Figure 4-51</a>. Line of Sight of Each Eye when Viewing Anaglyphs</b>
</p><p>
Now suppose you are to perceive the point to be at a distance
<i>D</i> - <i>Z</i> from your eyes (a distance <i>Z</i> in front
of the computer screen) as shown in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig4-51.gif">Figure 4-51</a> (b). We must then
plot two points on the computer screen separated horizontally
by a distance <i>d</i>. From the similarity of the two triangles

we calculate 
</p><p>
<i>d</i> = <i>eZ</i> / (<i>D</i>-<i>Z</i>)          (Eq. 4C)
</p><p>
The formula works also for negative <i>Z</i>.
</p><p>
To achieve the proper <i>linear perspective</i>
we should plot
the closer points a little farther apart than the more distant
points
but with unfamiliar objects such as strange attractors

there is little reason to do so. The approximation of Equation
4C causes some expansion of the image for negative <i>Z</i> (behind
the screen) and compression of the image for positive <i>Z</i>
(in front of the screen). This compression can be desirable to
keep the image always in front of your face rather than to let
it pass behind your head.
</p><p>
The length of most people's arms is almost exactly ten times
the distance between their eyes. Therefore
a value of <i>D</i>
/ <i>e</i> = 10 is appropriate for a computer screen viewed at
arm's length. In practice
the viewing distance is not very critical.
The perceived depth of the image is enhanced by viewing from a
greater distance
but it usually takes longer for the brain to
accommodate
and so it is often best to view first from close
up. It sometimes speeds the adjustment to move your head from
side to side.
</p><p>
A computer display optimized for viewing at arm's length is very
effective when projected on a large screen and viewed in an auditorium.
Were this not the case
three-dimensional movies could not be
shown to theater audiences. In such a case the brain perceives
a scaled version of the image at a closer distance. The same effect
occurs when viewing 2-D movies. The characters on the screen are
not perceived as giants a large distance from the viewer. Similarly

the brain is able to compensate almost without limit to other
distortions if the objects are familiar. A movie viewed from the
right-most seat in the front row appears normal after a short
period of adjustment.
</p><p>
It is important to maintain a somewhat limited depth and field
of view. Leonardo da Vinci recommended that a painting be optimally
viewed from a distance equal to three times its width. Most computer
screens approximately satisfy this criterion when viewed at arm's
length. An object as deep as it is wide will thus require that
the two images be separated by up to about an inch
requiring
that the eyes toe-in by about 3 degrees.
</p><p>
The computational task therefore is to plot each point that makes
up the attractor twice with a horizontal separation proportional
to the distance the point is to appear in front of or behind the
screen and to arrange that one set of points be visible only to
the left eye and the other only to the right eye. In the anaglyphic
process
this is done by plotting one set of points in red and
the other in the complementary cyan (blue-green) and viewing through
appropriate color-filtered glasses. By convention
the left eye
should only respond to the red and the right eye only to the cyan.
</p><p>
Note that individuals who are color blind should experience no
difficulty since it is unnecessary (and indeed undesirable) to
perceive the individual colors; it is only necessary that the
eyes be sensitive to them. Certain other eye defects
particularly
those resulting in ocular asymmetry
are more problematic.
</p><p>
You can plot the points on either a black or a white background.
With a black background
the images fuse into white (additive
process)
and with a white background
the images fuse into black
(subtractive process). The sense of <i>Z</i> is reversed with
the choice of background. With a black background the red is seen
through the red filter on the left eye
while for a white background

red is seen through the cyan filter on the right eye. In practice
the white background is usually more satisfactory
but you may
want to try it both ways to see which works best for you. Wherever
a red and cyan point overlap
they should be plotted as a single
black point if the background is white or as a single white point
if the background is black. The changes required to the program
to produce such anaglyphs are shown in the listing <b>PROG15</b>.

The program <b>PROG15</b> assumes EGA or VGA graphics and a color

you can obtain satisfactory
results in SCREEN 1 by changing the colors in line 5640 to <i>WH%</i>
= 3: <i>BK%</i> = 0: <i>RD%</i> = 2: <i>CY%</i> = 1.
</p><p>
Some sample anaglyphs are shown in Plates 9 through 16. Use the
special glasses included with the book. If these glasses are missing

you can probably find a suitable pair at a comic book store. If
you have difficulty acclimating to the anaglyphs
try viewing
them from close-up and then back away once you see the effect.
You may need some practice
especially since the attractors you
are viewing are unfamiliar objects and they lack other depth clues.
You might also try reversing the glasses (red over right eye)

which reverses in and out.
</p><p>
Because of the large variation of computer monitor colors and
spectacle filters
ghost images are common. Manipulation of the
computer color palette is of limited use since the monitor ultimately
constructs its colors from three distinct phosphors (red
green

and blue). The usual problem is inadequate rejection of the green
by the red filter
resulting in a red ghost image when viewed
against a white background. Suppression of the green by using
only red and blue on a magenta background eliminates this problem
but yields poor contrast of the resulting image. In some cases
the ghost images can be suppressed by viewing through multiple
pairs of glasses. You may want to adjust the intensity of the
red
green
and blue so that the images seen by each eye through
the glasses have similar intensities.
</p><p>
<b>4.7  Stereo Pairs  |  Stereo Pairs</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>Believe it or not
with a bit of practice
you can learn
to view attractors in 3-D without special glasses. For this purpose

we print the two images side-by-side in the same color instead
of superimposed on one another in different colors as we did with
the anaglyphs. This technique permits full color displays
and
we will exploit this capability in the next chapter. For the moment

let's consider only monochrome images.
</p><p>
First we develop the computer program necessary to produce the
images. The images should not be separated more than the distance
between your eyes
which for most people is about 6.5 cm. If the
images are separated by a larger distance
the eyes have to rotate
outward beyond the normal parallel position
which at best is
uncomfortable
and at worst impossible. Such images are described
as being <i>walleyed</i>. However
if we reduce the images to
a sufficiently small size on the computer screen
the resolution
will be poor. Therefore
we will plot the images as large as possible
and rely on the printer to reduce the size for comfortable viewing.
If you prefer to sacrifice the resolution and view the attractors
directly on the screen
the program is written to make it easy
for you to do so. Alternately
your monitor may have an adjustment
that allows you to shrink the width of the image.

The listing <b>PROG16</b> shows the changes required to produce
such stereo pairs.

<p>
If you want to shrink the image for direct viewing from the computer
screen
change the horizontal scale factor (<i>HSF</i>) in line
5250 from 2 to a larger value that separates the images by about
6.5 centimeters
or less if you are having trouble adapting to
them.
</p><p>
Sample stereo pairs produced by this technique are shown in Figures
4-52 through 4-67. You should hold them exactly horizontally

directly in front of your face at a normal reading distance and
gaze into the distance until you see three images. The one in
the middle should appear in 3-D
and the ones on each side
which
you must train yourself to ignore
should be in 2-D.</p><hr>

You may find it difficult to adjust to the images at first
but
with practice you should be able to see them almost instantly.
Viewing them should be relaxing
with a sensation resembling a
blank stare. Effort is required to return to normal viewing
much
like returning to the words on this page after gazing into the
distance.
</p><p>
It might help to close your eyes momentarily and then reopen
them if you are having trouble adapting. You can also buy an inexpensive
hand <i>stereoscope</i> containing prisms that separate and magnify
the images so that you can view them from a closer distance. Such
viewing forces the side images out of your field of view and eases
the adjustment to the middle image.
</p><p>
In the 1950's
the View-Master stereo viewer was very popular
for home use
and many stereoscopic photographs were produced.
Their popularity has waned
and the View-Master is no longer made

but similar inexpensive models can still be found in toy stores

often with images of cartoon characters. Stereo images are usually
photographed with a dual camera whose separation can be increased
beyond the normal eye separation to enhance the depth sensation
in what is called <i>hyperstereo</i>.
</p><p>
Stereoscopic images are used extensively by geologists and cartographers
to determine terrain elevation from aerial photographs. As an
airplane or satellite travels across the Earth
photographs are
taken at two positions separated by a distance much greater than
the distance between the eyes. When viewed through a stereoscope

the Earth appears as a scaled model viewed from just a foot or
so above
and it is easy to discern the elevation changes.
</p><p>
The preceding technique is called <i>free viewing</i>. An alternate
and more difficult technique
called <i>short-focus viewing</i>

can also be used to view the stereo pairs. Here the procedure
is to place the figure at arm's length but to look at a point
about halfway to the figure. It may help to hold your finger at
the halfway point and to cross your eyes until you see a single
image of your finger. You should then see the three images of
the figure float up off the page in the plane of your finger.
The middle image should be three-dimensional. It may be difficult
to keep the image from wavering and returning to the plane of
the page. Squinting sometimes helps.
</p><p>
An advantage of short-focus viewing is that the images can be
separated by a much larger distance
and so it will work for projection
on a large screen in a classroom or auditorium. However
note
that the image is in-out reversed from what it is with free viewing.
This reversal is called <i>pseudostereo</i>. With anaglyphs
pseudostereo
can be obtained by reversing the glasses. Pseudostereo images
would usually be very undesirable and would lead to all kinds
of visual contradictions
but with our strange attractors where
there are no other visual depth cues
it makes little difference.
It can even be an advantage to be able to view the objects in
either of these ways. Can you guess what you will see if you turn
the figures upside down? Think about it
and then give it a try.
</p><p>
You will note that with free viewing
the left image disappears
when you close your right eye and the right image disappears when
you close your left eye. With short-focus viewing
the opposite
occurs. However
it is incorrect to assume that each eye sees
only one of the images. Both eyes see both images
and the images
fuse into one when your eyes are aimed in the proper direction.
</p><p>
<b>4.8  Slices</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>We will discuss one final way to view attractors resulting
from three-dimensional maps. Low-dimensional attractors are like
loosely wound balls of string
whereas high-dimensional ones are
more like loaves of bread filled with holes. Anaglyphs and stereo
pairs are effective for cases of low dimension
but as the dimension
increases
the attractor becomes too opaque
and the illusion
of depth is lost.
</p><p>
Carrying the loaf-of-bread analogy a bit farther
you could imagine
slicing the loaf into a large number of very thin slices. The
result is to decrease the dimension of the object by one. For
example
an object with a fractal dimension of 2.5 would become
an object of dimension of 1.5 in each slice. This is an example
of what is called a <i>Poincaré section</i> (as in "cross-section").
</p><p>
Perhaps it's easier to consider a specific case. Suppose the
attractor were a loosely wound ball of very thin string. The attractor
would then be essentially one-dimensional. The string would cross
the slices at a number of points. Thus the slices would contain
dots wherever the string pierced them. A set of a finite number
of dots is an object of zero dimension.
</p><p>
If the attractor were a loosely crumpled piece of paper
its
dimension would be close to two. If you were to cut a thin slice
through the crumpled paper
you would be left with a handful of
worm-like paper strings
which are one-dimensional objects. You
should now set the book down
get a piece of paper and a pair
of scissors
and try it for yourself. Be sure to make the slice
as thin as possible.
</p><p>
With our maps
which contain only a finite number of points

we cannot make the slices too thin
lest they contain so few points
as to be invisible. Furthermore
it is impractical to look at
all the slices if they are very thin because there are too many
of them. As always
we have to compromise. We'll use sixteen slices
and lay them out in a 4 x 4 array so that we can see them all
at once. On the computer screen
this method entails a serious
sacrifice in resolution
but it does illustrate the principle.
You might want to experiment with using a larger number of slices
but displaying only a fraction of them. For example
try using
64 slices
and display every fourth one.

Figures 4-68 through 4-83 show some sample attractors displayed
as a succession of slices. The succession is from left to right
and top to bottom in the same way you read (in most Western languages

at least). In these cases the attractor dimension is greater than
two; otherwise the dimension of the slices would be too small
to be interesting.</p><hr>

<b> </b>In this chapter we have described a number of techniques
whereby three-dimensional information can be exhibited on a computer
screen or printed page. However
none of these displays is truly
three-dimensional. You have seen the term "3-D" used
loosely in advertisements for computer graphics
often meaning
little more than a perspective drawing or a view from an oblique
angle. In a true three-dimensional display
the viewer must be
able to see behind an object by moving his or her head from side
to side. A holographic display allows this
but most so-called
3-D displays do not. Anaglyphs and stereo pairs are probably better
described as <i>stereoscopic</i> displays. They merely provide
the illusion of 3-D
as do shadows. Techniques using bands
colors

and slices deserve even less to be called 3-D
however useful
they are for conveying information about the third dimension.
You should be appropriately discerning when confronted with graphics
claimed to be 3-D.</p><hr>

<b>CHAPTER 5</b>
</p><p>
<b>The Fourth Dimension</b>
</p><p>
Although we normally think of space as three-dimensional
mathematics
is not so constrained. Strange attractors can be embedded in 
space of four and even higher dimensions. Their calculation is
a straightforward extension of what we have done before. The challenge
is to find ways to visualize such high-dimensional objects. This
chapter will exploit a number of appropriate visualization techniques
after a digression to explain why dimensions higher than three
are useful for describing the world in which we live.
</p><p>
<b>5.1  Hyperspace</b>
</p><p>
Ordinary space is three-dimensional. The position of any point
relative to an arbitrary origin can be characterized by a set
of three numbers--the distance forward or back
right or left

up or down. An object
such as a solid ball
in this space may
itself be three-dimensional
or perhaps
like an eggshell of negligible
thickness
it may be two-dimensional. You can also imagine an
infinitely fine thread
which is one-dimensional
or the period
at the end of this sentence
which is essentially zero-dimensional.
Although we can easily visualize objects with dimension less than
or equal to 3
it is hard to envision space of higher dimension.
</p><p>
Before discussing the fourth dimension
it is useful to clarify
and refine some familiar terms. Perhaps the best example of a
one-dimensional object is a straight line. The line may stretch
to infinity in both directions
or it may have ends. A line remains
one-dimensional even if it bends
in which case we call it a <i>curve</i>.
</p><p>
When we say that a curve is one-dimensional
we are referring
to its <i>topological dimension</i>. By contrast the <i>Euclidean
dimension</i> is the dimension of the space in which the curve
is embedded. If the line is straight
both dimensions are one

but if it curves
the Euclidean dimension must be higher than
the topological dimension. Both dimensions are integers. One definition
of a fractal is an object whose Hausdorff-Besicovitch (fractal)
dimension exceeds its topological dimension. For example a coastline
on a flat map has a topological dimension of one
a Euclidean
dimension of two
and a fractal dimension between one and two.
It is an infinitely long line.
</p><p>
A special and important example of a curve is a <i>circle</i>

which is curve of finite length but without ends
every segment
of which lies at a constant distance from a point at the center.
Every circle lies in a <i>plane</i>
which is a flat
two-dimensional
entity. Like a line
the plane may stretch to infinity in all
directions
or it may have <i>edges</i>. If a plane has an edge

we call it a <i>disk</i>. Note the distinction between a <i>circle</i>

which is a one-dimensional object that does not include its interior

and a <i>disk</i>
which is a two-dimensional object that includes
the interior.
</p><p>
Just as not all lines are straight
not all two-dimensional objects
are flat. A sheet of paper of negligible thickness remains two-dimensional
if it is curled or even crumpled up
in which case it is no longer
a plane
but it is still a <i>surface</i>. A curved surface has
a Euclidean dimension of at least three. A surface can be finite
but without edges. An example is a <i>sphere</i>
every segment
of which is at a constant distance from its center.
</p><p>
Note that just as a circle doesn't include its interior
neither
does a sphere. When we want to refer to the three-dimensional
region bounded by a sphere
we call it a <i>ball</i>. This terminology
is universal among mathematicians
but not among physicists
who
sometimes consider the dimension of circles and spheres to be
the minimum dimension of the space in which they can be embedded
(2 and 3
respectively).
</p><p>
Another example of a finite surface without edges is a <i>torus</i>

most familiar as the surface of a doughnut or inner tube. Such
curved spaces without edges are useful whenever one of the variables
is periodic. Spaces of arbitrary dimensions
whether flat or curved

are called <i>manifolds</i>. The branch of mathematics that deals
with these shapes is called <i>topology</i>.
</p><p>
If we could describe the world purely by specifying the position
of objects
three dimensions would suffice. However
if you consider
the motion of a baseball
you are interested not only in where
it is
but in how fast it is moving and in what direction. Six
numbers are needed to specify both its position and its velocity.
This six-dimensional space is called <i>phase space</i>. Furthermore

if the balls are spinning
six more dimensions are needed for
each ball
one to specify the angle
and another the angular velocity
about each of three perpendicular axes through the ball.
</p><p>
If you have <i>two</i> balls that move independently
you need
a phase space with <i>twice</i> as many (twelve) dimensions
and
so forth. Contemplate the phase-space dimension required to specify
the motion of more than 1025 molecules in every cubic meter of
air! Sometimes physicists even find it useful to perform calculations
in an infinite-dimensional space
called <i>Hilbert space</i>.
</p><p>
You might also be interested in other properties of the balls
such as their temperature
color
or radius. Thus the state of
the balls as time advances can be described by a curve
or <i>trajectory</i>

in some high-dimensional space
called <i>state space</i>
in
which the various perpendicular directions correspond to the quantities
that describe the balls. The trajectory is a curve connecting
temporally successive points in state space.
</p><p>
You have probably heard of <i>time</i> referred to as the <i>fourth
dimension</i> and associate the idea with the <i>theory of relativity</i>.
Long before Einstein
it was obvious that to specify an <i>event</i>

as opposed to a <i>location</i>
it is necessary to specify not
only <i>where</i> the event occurred (<i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
and
<i>Z</i>) but <i>when</i> (<i>T</i>). We can consider events to
be points in this four-dimensional space.
</p><p>
Note that the spatial coordinates of a point are not unique.
An object four feet in front of one observer might be six feet
to the right of a second and two feet above a third. The values
of <i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
and <i>Z</i>  of the position depend on
where the coordinate system is located and how it is oriented.
However
we would expect the various observers to agree on the
<i>separation</i> between any two locations. Similarly we expect
all observers to agree on the <i>time interval</i> between two
events.
</p><p>
The special theory of relativity asserts that observers usually
do <i>not</i> agree on either the separation or the time interval
between two events. Events that are simultaneous for one observer
will not be simultaneous for a second moving relative to the first.
Similarly
two successive events at the same position as seen
by one observer will be seen at different positions by the other.
</p><p>
You have probably heard that according to the special theory
of relativity
moving clocks run slow and moving meter sticks
are shortened. (It is also true that the effective mass of an
object increases when it moves
leading to the famous <i>E</i>
= <i>mc</i>2
but that's another story.)  These discrepancies
remain even after the observers correct for their motion and for
the time required for the information about the events to reach
them traveling at the speed of light. It is important to understand
that these facts have nothing to do with the properties of clocks
and meter sticks and that they are not illusions; they are properties
of space and time
neither of which possess the absolute qualities
we normally ascribe to them.
</p><p>
What is remarkable is that all observers agree on the separation
between the events in four-dimensional <i>space-time</i>. This
separation is called the <i>proper length</i>
and it is calculated
from the Pythagorean theorem by taking the square root of the
sum of the squares of the four components after converting the
time interval (Æ<i>T</i>) to a distance by multiplying it
by the speed of light (<i>c</i>). The only subtlety is that the
square of the time enters as a <i>negative</i> quantity:
</p><p>
Proper length = [Æ<i>X</i>2 + Æ<i>Y</i>2 + Æ<i>Z</i>2
- <i>c</i>2Æ<i>T</i>2]1/2          (Eq. 5A)
</p><p>
Because of the minus sign
time is considered to be an <i>imaginary</i>
dimension
since an imaginary number is one whose square is negative.
Note
however
that <i>imaginary</i> does not mean it is any less
real than the other dimensions
only that its square combines
with the others through <i>subtraction</i> rather than through
<i>addition</i>. If you are unfamiliar with imaginary numbers

don't be put off by the name. They aren't really imaginary; they
are just the other part of certain quantities that require a pair
of numbers rather than a single number to specify them.
</p><p>
The minus sign also means that proper length
unlike ordinary
length
may be imaginary. If the proper length is imaginary
we
say the events are separated in a <i>time-like</i>
as opposed
to a <i>space-like</i>
manner. Time-like events can be <i>causally</i>
related (one event can influence the other)
but space-like events
cannot
because information about one would have to travel faster
than the speed of light to reach the other
which is impossible.
Events separated in a time-like manner are more conveniently characterized
by a <i>proper time</i>:
</p><p>
Proper time = [Æ<i>T</i>2 - Æ<i>X</i>2/<i>c</i>2 -
Æ<i>Y</i>2/<i>c</i>2 - Æ<i>Z</i>2/<i>c</i>2]1/2  
(Eq. 5B)
</p><p>
In this case
time is real
but space is imaginary. Proper length
is the length of an object as measured by an observer moving with
the same velocity as the object
and proper time is the time interval
as measured by a clock moving with the same velocity as the observer.
</p><p>
Quantities such as proper length and proper time on which all
observers agree
independent of their motion
are called <i>invariants</i>.
The speed of light itself is an invariant. There are many others

and they all involve four components that combine by the Pythagorean
theorem.
</p><p>
Thus the theory of relativity ties space and time together in
a very fundamental way. One person's space is another person's
time. Since space and time can be traded back and forth
there
is no reason to call time the <i>fourth</i> dimension any more
than we call width the <i>second</i> dimension. It is better just
to say that <i>space-time</i> is four-dimensional
with each dimension
on an equal footing. The apparent asymmetry between space and
time comes from the large value of <i>c</i> (3 x 108 meters per
second
or about a billion miles per hour) and the fact that time
moves in only one direction (past to future). It is also important
to understand that
although special relativity is called a <i>theory</i>

it has been extensively verified to high accuracy by many experiments

most of which involve particle accelerators.
</p><p>
The foregoing discussion motivates why it might be useful to
consider  four-dimensional space and four-dimensional objects

but it is probably fruitless to waste too much time trying to
visualize them. However
we can describe them mathematically as
extensions of familiar objects in lower dimensions.
</p><p>
For example
a <i>hypercube</i> is the four-dimensional extension
of the three-dimensional cube and the two-dimensional square.
It has 16 corners
32 edges
24 faces
and contains 8 cubes. Its
<i>hypervolume</i> is the fourth power of the length of each edge

just as the volume of a cube is the cube of the length of an edge
and the area of a square is the square of the length of an edge.
</p><p>
A <i>hypersphere</i> consists of all points at a given distance
from its center in four-dimensional space. Its <i>hypersurface</i>
is three-dimensional and consists of an infinite family of spheres

just as the surface of an ordinary sphere is two-dimensional and
consists of an infinite family of circles. There is reason to
believe that our Universe might be a hypersurface of a very large
hypersphere
in which case we could see ourselves if we peered
far enough into space
except for the fact that we are also looking
backwards to a time before the Earth existed. We would also need
an incredibly powerful telescope to see the Earth in this way.
Thus our perception that space is three-dimensional could be analogous
to the ancient view that the Earth was flat
a consequence of
experience limited to a small portion of its surface.
</p><p>
<b>5.2  Projections</b>
</p><p>
The previous section was intended to motivate the consideration
of strange attractors embedded in four-dimensional space
but
most of the discussion there is not essential to what follows.
We will now describe the computer program necessary to produce
attractors in four dimensions and then develop methods to visualize
them.
</p><p>
The mathematical generalization from three to four dimensions
is straightforward. Whereas before we had three variables--<i>X</i>

<i>Y</i>
and <i>Z</i>--we now have a fourth. Having used up the
three letters at the end of the alphabet
we will back up and
use <i>W</i> for the fourth dimension
but remember that all the
dimensions are on an equal footing. We will use the first letters
M
N
O
and P to code 4-D attractors of second through fifth
order
respectively. The number of coefficients for these cases
is 60
140
280
and 504
respectively. The number of coefficients
for order <i>O</i> is (<i>O</i> + 1)(<i>O</i> + 2)(<i>O</i> +
3)(<i>O</i> + 4) / 6. The number of four-dimensional
fifth-order
codes is 25504
a number too large to compare to anything meaningful;
it might as well be infinite.
</p><p>
The program modifications required to add a fourth dimension
are shown in the listing <b>PROG18</b>.

<p>
If you run the program <b>PROG18</b> under certain old versions
of BASIC such as BASICA and GW-BASIC
you are likely to get an
error in line 2710 when the program attempts to construct a code
for the fourth-order and fifth-order maps as a result of the string-length
limit of 255 characters. In such a case
you may need to restrict
the search to second and third orders by setting <i>OMAX%</i>
= 3 in line 1060. Alternately
it's not difficult to modify the
program to store the code in a pair of strings or to replace the
string with a one-dimensional array of integers containing the
numeric equivalents of each character in the string
perhaps with
a terminating zero to signify the end of the string. Thus
for
example
line 2710 would become
</p><p>
2710        <i>CODE%</i>(<i>I%</i>) = 65 + INT(25 * <i>RAN</i>)
</p><p>
and line 2740 would become
</p><p>
2740    <i>A</i>(<i>I%</i>) = (<i>CODE%</i>(<i>I%</i>) - 77) /
10
</p><p>
after dimensioning <i>CODE%</i>(504) in line 1020.
</p><p>
You will also notice that the search for attractors is painfully
slow unless you have a very fast computer and a good compiler.
You should refer to Table 2.2 where some options for increasing
the speed are examined. The search can be made faster by limiting
it to second order by setting <i>OMAX%</i> = 2 in line 1060.
</p><p>
There is another trick to increase drastically the rate at which
four-dimensional strange attractors are found without sacrificing
variety. It turns out that most of these attractors have their
constant terms near zero. The reason presumably has to do with
the fact that the origin (<i>X</i> = <i>Y</i> = <i>Z</i> = <i>W</i>
= 0) is then a fixed point and the initial condition is chosen
near the origin (<i>X</i>0 = <i>Y</i>0 = <i>Z</i>0 = <i>W</i>0
= 0.05). If the fixed point is unstable
then we have one of the
conditions necessary for chaos. It is easy to accomplish this
by adding after line 2730 a statement such as: 
</p><p>
2735    IF <i>I%</i> MOD <i>M%</i> / <i>D%</i> = 1 THEN MID$(<i>CODE$</i>

<i>I%</i> + 1
1) = "M"
</p><p>
The result is to increase the rate of finding attractors by about
a factor of fifty. Many of the attractors illustrated in this
chapter were produced in this way. This change will also increase
the rate for lower-dimensional maps
but by a much smaller factor.
This improvement suggests that there is yet room to optimize the
search routine by a more intelligent choice of the values of the
other coefficients.
</p><p>
Note that the program <b>PROG18</b> does not attempt to display
the fourth dimension
but rather projects it onto the other three

for which all the visualization techniques of the last chapter
are available. Don't waste too much time trying to understand
what it means to project a four-dimensional object onto a three-dimensional
space. It is just a generalization of projecting a three-dimensional
object onto a two-dimensional surface. In the program
it simply
involves plotting <i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
and <i>Z</i>
and ignoring
the variable <i>W</i>.
</p><p>
Some examples of four-dimensional attractors projected onto the
two-dimensional <i>XY</i>-plane are shown in Figures 5-1 through
5-20. They don't look particularly different from those obtained
by projecting three-dimensional attractors onto the plane
or

indeed
by just plotting two-dimensional attractors directly.
Note that most of these attractors have fractal dimensions less
than or about 2.0
and so perhaps it is not too surprising that
their projections resemble those produced by equations of lower
dimension. It is rare to find attractors with fractal dimensions
greater than 3.0 produced by four-dimensional polynomial maps

as will be shown in Section 8.1.</p><hr>

<b>5.3  Other Display Techniques</b>
</p><p>
Projecting two of the four dimensions onto the remaining two
is akin to buying a Ferrari to make trips to the grocery store.
Much of our effort is wasted. We need to use the techniques developed
in the last chapter to display three dimensions and devise additional
methods to display simultaneously the fourth dimension.
</p><p>
Since we have several methods for displaying three dimensions

we should be able to use some of them in combination to visualize
all four dimensions. Table 5.1 summarizes the display techniques
that we have used and indicates the number of dimensions that
can be visualized with various combinations of them. In the table

a dash indicates that the combination is not possible
and a question
mark indicates that the combination is possible but leads to contradictory
visual information.

In presenting sample displays from <b>PROG19</b> we ignore those
that convey only three-dimensional information
and concentrate
on the new combinations that permit full four-dimensional displays.
They fall into two groups--those that require the use of color
and those that do not. Examples of the three 4-D monochrome combinations
are shown in Figures 5-21 through 5-44
and examples of the six
color combinations are shown in Plates 17 through 22.</p><hr>

<b> </b>You might be interested in the challenge of producing
attractors embedded in dimensions higher than four. In five dimensions

you need to define a new variable
say <i>V</i>
and modify the
program as was done for four dimensions in <b>PROG18</b>. The
program has been written to make it relatively easy to extend
it to five or even higher dimensions. Be forewarned that the calculation
will be very slow. You will almost certainly want to set the coefficients
of the constant terms to zero and probably restrict your search
to quadratic maps. The number of fifth-dimension polynomial coefficients
for order <i>O</i> is (<i>O</i> + 1)(<i>O</i> + 2)(<i>O</i> +
3)(<i>O</i> + 4)(<i>O</i> + 5) / 24. With <i>O</i> = 5
the number
is 1260.
</p><p>
The simplest display technique is to project the fifth dimension
onto the other four. This is what the program does automatically
if you don't do anything special. There are several combinations
of techniques
which we have already developed
that are capable
of displaying five dimensions. You might try combining shadows

bands
and color
for example. Table 5.2 lists the seven possible
combinations of five-dimensional display techniques that don't
lead to visual contradictions.
</p><p>
<b>Table 5.2  Combinations of Display Techniques That Can Be Used
in Five Dimensions</b></p><hr>
Shadow  Bands  Color<hr>
Shadow  Bands  SlicesShadow  Color  SlicesBands  Color  StereoBands
Anaglyph  SlicesBands  Stereo  SlicesColor  Stereo  Slices
<p>
For a heroic exercise in programming
visualization
and patience

you can try to extend the calculation to six dimensions. A six-dimensional

fifth-order system of polynomials has 2772 coefficients. There
are only two appropriate combinations of display techniques suitable
for six dimensions: shadow-bands-color-slices and bands-color-stereo-slices.
If you decide to try seven dimensions
you will have to invent
a new display technique.
</p><p>
<b>5.4  Writing on the Wall</b>
</p><p>
Since four-dimensional attractors have the greatest complexity
and variety of all the cases described in this book
they offer
the greatest potential as display art  For such purposes
you
will probably want to print them on a large sheet of paper. With
an appropriate printer or plotter
any of the visualization techniques
previously described can be used to produce such large prints.
</p><p>
An alternate technique that has proved very successful is an
extension of the character-based method described in Section 4.5.
In this technique the third dimension is coded as an ASCII character
with a density related to the <i>Z</i>-value
and the fourth dimension
is coded in color. Color pen and pencil plotters and ink-jet plotters

as well as more expensive but high quality electrostatic and thermal
plotters
normally used for engineering and architectural drawings

can print text on sheets up to 36 inches wide. Ink-jet plotters
are growing in popularity over the more traditional pen plotters
because they are faster and quieter and don't require special
paper. They can also print gray scales. With care
you can piece
together smaller segments printed by more conventional means.
</p><p>
When the attractors are reduced to sequences of text
resolutions
of 640 by 480 (VGA) or 800 by 600 (Super VGA) produce large figures
whose individual characters can be read when examined closely
but that blend into continuous contours when viewed from a distance.
Artists often use this technique in which the viewer is provided
with a different visual experience on different scales. You should
use the largest and boldest characters available to maximize the
contrast
provided they remain readable. There should be little
or no space between rows and columns of characters. With a pen
plotter
the pen size can be chosen for the best compromise of
contrast and readability. A pen that makes a line width of 0.35
mm (fine) is a reasonable choice.
</p><p>
Inks are available in only a limited number of colors
and pen
plotters are usually capable of accommodating only a small number
of pens. The pens can be sequenced to place compatible colors
next to one another. With eight pens and commonly available inks

a good sequence is magenta
red
orange (or yellow)
brown
black

green
turquoise
and blue. The closest color sequence for viewing
on the computer screen from Table 4.1 is 13
12
4 (or 14)
6

8
2
3
and 9
with a white (15) background. With upwards of
twenty characters producing different color intensities
the limitation
of eight colors of ink is not a serious one. With eight colors
and ASCII codes from 32 to 255
you can have 28 different intensities
for each color. The inks can be mixed to produce different shades
of the colors. Pencils are less expensive and don't clog or dry
out as pens often do
but pencil plots have a tendency to smudge.
Ink of course will also smudge until it is thoroughly dry. Plotters
are relatively slow
and attractors produced by this method typically
require a few hours to a full day to produce.
</p><p>
Paper commonly used for engineering drawings comes in at least
five standard sizes--A (8 1/2 by 11 inch)
B (12 by 18 inch)

C (18 by 24 inch)
D (24 by 36 inch)
and E (36 by 48 inch). English
sizes and architectural sizes are slightly different
and thus
a sheet may vary somewhat from these dimensions. Thirty-six-inch-wide
paper is also available on long rolls.
</p><p>
Common paper types are tracing <i>bond</i>
which is the most
economical
<i>vellum</i>
which is smooth and translucent
and
<i>polyester film</i>
which is highly translucent
dimensionally
stable
and relatively expensive. The translucent papers offer
the interesting possibility of backing the print with a monochrome
or color copy of itself to enhance the contrast or to produce
a shadow effect if the two are displaced slightly. Other interesting
effects can be achieved by backing one translucent attractor with
a print of another or by back-lighting the print. Some of the
papers stretch slightly and thus have a tendency to wrinkle. Paper
with significant acid content should be avoided since it turns
yellow and becomes brittle with age.
</p><p>
Some of the most artistic examples of strange attractors have
been produced by these techniques
but they cannot be adequately
illustrated in this book. No computer program is offered
since
it is so dependent on your hardware. You will want to experiment
to find the technique that works best for you and that makes the
most effective use of your printer or plotter.
</p><p>
<b>5.5  Murals and Movies</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>The technique of making large-scale attractors for display
can be carried to its logical extreme by making a mural. Special
techniques using some type of stencil are required to transform
the computer output to paint on the wall. Silk screen is useful
for transferring the image to fabrics. Fractal tee-shirts employing
this technique have recently become popular.
</p><p>
To produce a mural you will probably need to start with a large
number of plots
each showing a small section of the attractor.
A property of fractals is that they have detail on all scales

and thus a large mural should look interesting when viewed either
from a distance or close up.
</p><p>
You might also photograph the computer screen or a high quality
print and produce slides that can be projected onto a large surface
or screen with a slide projector. Equipment is available commercially
for producing slides directly from digital computer output. A
sequence of such slides makes a very compelling presentation or
visual accompaniment to a lecture or musical production.
</p><p>
The color slices as shown in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/plate22.gif">Plate 22</a> suggest the possibility
of making color movies by extending the technique to a very large
number of slices and using each one as a frame of a movie. The
effect is to cause the attractor to emerge at a point in an empty
field and to grow slowly
bending and wiggling until fully developed

and then to disappear slowly into a different point. If the technology
for doing this is unavailable
you might try printing a large
number of attractor slices on small cards and fanning through
them to produce a semblance of animation. This technique
with
attractors described in Section 7.6
was used to produce the animation
in the upper-right corner of the odd pages of this book.
</p><p>
If the idea of making strange-attractor movies appeals to you

another technique is to take one of your favorite attractors and
slowly change one or more of the coefficients in successive frames
of the movie. A good way to start is to multiply all the coefficients
by a factor that varies from slightly less than 1.0 to slightly
greater than 1.0. You will need to determine the range over which
the coefficients can be changed without the solutions becoming
unbounded or non-chaotic. The ends of this range then become the
beginning and end of the movie.
</p><p>
Sometimes the attractor slowly and continuously alters its shape.
The changes can involve bifurcations such as the period-doubling
sequence in the logistic equation described in Chapter 1. Such
bifurcations are called <i>subtle</i>. Other times the attractor
and its basin will abruptly disappear at a critical value of the
control parameter. Such <i>discontinuous bifurcations</i> are
called <i>catastrophes</i>.
</p><p>
If the control parameter is changed in the opposite direction

the result may be different from simply running the movie backwards.
This is an example of <i>hysteresis</i>
which is a form of memory
in a dynamical system. It serves to limit the occurrence of catastrophes.
The thermostat that controls your heat probably uses hysteresis
to keep the furnace from cycling on and off too frequently. Catastrophic
bifurcations usually exhibit hysteresis
whereas subtle bifurcations
do not.
</p><p>
These four-dimensional maps are also well suited for color holographic
display or for experimentation with virtual reality
in which
the view is controlled by motion of one's head and hands to give
the sensation of moving through the object. The technology is
complicated
but the results should be visually and mentally stimulating.
</p><p>
<b>5.6  Search and Destroy</b>
</p><p>
If you have worked carefully through the text
your program will
have created a disk file <b>SA.DIC</b> containing the codes of
all the attractors generated since you ran the program <b>PROG11</b>.
We will now develop the capability to examine these attractors
and save the interesting ones in a file <b>FAVORITE.DIC</b>
while
discarding the others. This feature will allow you to run the
program overnight and collect attractors for rapid viewing the
next day. This capability is especially useful if you have a slow
computer. The required program changes are shown in the listing
<b>PROG20</b>.

You merely need to rename the <b>FAVORITE.DIC</b> file to <b>SA.DIC</b>

however
that the programs in this book are

</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 6</b>
</p><p>
<b>Fields and Flows</b>
</p><p>
In this chapter we consider equations whose iterates move gradually
rather than abruptly from one place to another. Such equations
are called differential equations
and they are the basis for
most dynamical systems that describe natural processes. The programming
is a simple extension of what we have done before
but the calculation
requires more computing time. The attractors produced by differential
equations consist of continuous lines whose weavings and waverings
describe the trajectory and yield objects of considerable beauty.
</p><p>
<b>6.1  Beam Me up Scotty!</b>
</p><p>
The maps in the previous chapters have the property that successive
iterates are usually at widely different positions on the attractor.
The points dance around like fleas jumping on the back of a dog

eventually
but gradually
visiting every allowed location. Most
processes in nature don't occur that way
but rather progress
slowly and continuously from some initial condition through a
succession of nearby intermediate states to the final condition.
</p><p>
If you take a trip across the country
your trajectory through
three-dimensional space (or even in four-dimensional space-time)
is a continuous
one-dimensional curve. Only in science fiction
is Captain Kirk able to dematerialize at one position and rematerialize
somewhere else
without occupying a succession of intermediate
positions. Most substances in nature obey a <i>continuity equation</i>

which guarantees that if their quantity decreases at some position

the decrease must be accompanied by a <i>flow</i> of the substance
away from the position. Note that this is a stronger condition
than a <i>conservation law</i>
which requires only that the total
quantity of the substance remains the same.
</p><p>
There is a relation between flows and maps. Imagine a fly trapped
in a room and moving in a complicated
random manner. Its trajectory
is a one-dimensional curve that will eventually fill the entire
room. However
if you observe the fly with a strobe lamp that
flashes periodically
the trajectory will be a succession of dots

with each dot separated from the previous dot by a significant
distance. The dots also eventually fill the entire three-dimensional
region
but it takes longer for this to occur.
</p><p>
However
if the fly's motion is chaotic
rather than random

neither the curve nor the dots will fill the room
but rather
they will lie on a strange attractor that occupies a negligible
portion of the room. The attractor consisting of all the possible
dots will often have a lower dimension than the attractor consisting
of all the possible curves. Thus a map can be thought of as a
crude description of a flow
in which the intervening details
of the motion are ignored.
</p><p>
It's easy to think of an object such as a fly or a human
imbued
with intelligence
however limited
moving by free will along
a complicated trajectory. However
inanimate objects
such as
astronomical bodies or sub-microscopic
electrically charged particles

can also execute complicated motions. They do so because they
move through a space filled with gravitational or electromagnetic
<i>fields</i>.
</p><p>
It is important to recognize that a field has no objective reality
other than to describe mathematically the force on an object moving
through it. When something is dropped
it falls toward the Earth.
It is a deeply philosophical question
not answered very well
by science
how the object <i>knows</i> to move toward the Earth
rather than in some other direction. We say that it is acted upon
by the gravitational field of the Earth
but this description

however useful for calculating the motion
begs the issue. Ultimately

the laws of physics describe very accurately <i>how</i> things
move
but not very well <i>why</i>.
</p><p>
The equations that describe flows are of a different type than
those that describe maps. They are called <i>differential equations</i>

and they involve the <i>rate of change</i> of a quantity. We will
consider only <i>ordinary</i> differential equations (ODEs)
as
distinguished from the <i>partial</i> differential equations (PDEs)
that are used to describe the behavior of complicated objects
like fluids whose state space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional.
Dynamical systems described by ODEs involve only the <i>time</i>
rate of change of the position of a point in state space
whereas
with PDEs the variables are quantities like density
temperature

and electric field that change in space as well as time. A wave
is an example of a dynamical system described by a PDE.
</p><p>
Consider an object moving in the <i>X</i>-direction. Its speed
is the rate of change of its position
and we will denote this
quantity by <i>X'</i> (pronounced "<i>X</i> prime").
It is the distance the object moves in a brief interval of time
divided by the time interval. If you know some calculus
you recognize
this as the <i>time-derivative</i> of <i>X</i>
usually denoted
by <i>dX</i>/<i>dt</i>. The rate of change of position is what
the speedometer on your car
or the police radar
reads. The rate
of change of the speed is the <i>acceleration</i>. More properly

we should call these quantities the <i>time</i> rate of change

since quantities can also change in space. For example
the <i>spatial</i>
rate of change in altitude of a road is called its <i>grade</i>.
</p><p>
An object moving in three-dimensional space will have a constantly
changing value not only of <i>X</i>
but also of <i>Y</i> and
<i>Z</i>. Furthermore
<i>X'</i>
<i>Y'</i>
and <i>Z'</i> will
usually depend on position (<i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
and <i>Z</i>).
For example
a particle moving clockwise in a circle about the
origin in the <i>XY</i>-plane is described by the following pair
of differential equations:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6A)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i>
</p><p>
Such a set of equations describes
at least approximately
the
motion of the Earth around the Sun. This type of regular motion
is not chaotic
and it does not lead to visually interesting strange
attractors.
</p><p>
Some differential equations can be solved easily using calculus.
For example
Equation 6A has the solution
</p><p>
<i>X</i> = <i>A</i> sin(<i>t</i> + f)
</p><p>
(Eq. 6B)
</p><p>
<i>Y</i> = <i>A</i> cos(<i>t</i> + f)
</p><p>
which specifies the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> positions at any time
<i>t</i>. The quantities <i>A</i> and f are constants that are
determined from the initial conditions (the values of <i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i> at <i>t</i> = 0). If you are interested only in the
shape of the trajectory
and not in where the object is along
it at any particular time
you can eliminate the <i>t</i> in Equations
6B to get a relation between <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>

</p><p>
<i>X</i>2 + <i>Y</i>2 = <i>A</i>2                    (Eq. 6C)
</p><p>
which is the equation for a circle of radius <i>A</i> centered
on the origin (<i>X</i> = <i>Y</i> = 0).
</p><p>
Equation 6A also arises in a different context. Imagine an object
moving back and forth in the <i>X</i>-direction
perhaps attached
to a spring that alternately stretches and compresses. Since <i>Y</i>
is equal to <i>X'</i>
we can associate <i>Y</i> with the <i>velocity</i>
in the <i>X</i>-direction. The <i>XY</i>-plane then becomes the
two-dimensional phase space for this one-dimensional motion
and
the trajectory in this plane is the phase-space trajectory. A
circular phase-space trajectory is a characteristic of a one-dimensional

<i>simple harmonic oscillator</i>
such as a mass on a spring.
Usually the phase-space trajectory is an ellipse
just as the
orbit of the Earth around the Sun is an ellipse
but we can always
measure <i>Y</i> in appropriate units
or adjust the scale of
the graph
to change the ellipse into a circle.
</p><p>
With this interpretation
the first of Equations 6A defines the
velocity (<i>Y</i>) as the rate of change of position (<i>X'</i>).
If you remember your physics
the second of Equations 6A is Newton's
second law (<i>F</i> = <i>ma</i>)
in which the force <i>F</i>
obeys <i>Hooke's law</i> for springs (<i>F</i> = - <i>kX</i>)
and the acceleration <i>a</i> is the rate of change of velocity
(<i>Y'</i>). It is interesting that the same set of differential
equations with a change in the meaning of the variables can describe
the motion of an object traveling in a circle or an object oscillating
on the end of a spring. Equations 6A describe many other phenomena
in nature such as the oscillations in an electrical circuit containing
a capacitor and inductor.
</p><p>
A two-dimensional system of differential equations such as Equation
6A cannot exhibit chaos since the trajectory cannot cross itself.
The most complicated bounded behavior is thus a simple closed
loop
corresponding to periodic motion. The reason the trajectory
cannot cross itself is that every point in the <i>XY</i>-plane
has associated with it a unique direction of flow
and thus the
trajectory must approach and leave every point in a single particular
direction. If the orbit were to return to a point previously
visited
it would thereafter repeat what it did before. In two
dimensions
the orbit can do only one of three things--it can
spiral into a fixed point
approach a stable limit cycle
or spiral
off to infinity.
</p><p>
Trajectories may <i>appear</i> to cross if they come very close
to a fixed point that is stable in one direction and unstable
in another (called a <i>saddle point</i> or <i>X-point</i> because
of its shape). Such a trajectory is called a <i>separatrix</i>
since it separates regions with different flows. Trajectories
approaching the fixed point on one side of the separatrix will
veer off to the right
and those approaching from the other side
will veer off to the left. Such a separatrix exists upstream (and
downstream) of an island in a river where two sticks placed side
by side in the water end up going around opposite sides of the
island. The island seems at first to attract the sticks and then
to repel them at right angles as they approach it.
</p><p>
In three dimensions
we have the possibility of an orbit wrapping
around in a complicated manner
like a ball of string
never intersecting
itself
but producing a never-ending tangle. By contrast
maps
can be chaotic in one or two dimensions
since the points jump
from place to place with little danger of intersecting another
point. Captain Kirk need not be concerned about a collision while
being transported from one point to another. He only needs to
worry about landing on top of a diabolical Klingon at his destination!
</p><p>
<b>6.2  Professor Lorenz and Dr. Rössler</b>
</p><p>
Although differential equations have been the mathematical basis
for most descriptions of nature for hundreds of years
almost
no one suspected that the trajectories resulting from their solution
could be a chaotic strange attractor. The history of the discovery
of such solutions is interesting and bears retelling.
</p><p>
In the early 1960's
Edward Lorenz
a meteorologist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology
was developing models of atmospheric
convection to be solved by a primitive computer that required
about one second per iteration. His models involved a large number
of differential equations and produced solutions that varied with
time in a complicated manner
not unlike the variation of the
weather over long intervals of time. On one occasion
he happened
to restart one of his computer runs using numbers rounded to three
digits rather than the six significant figures used by the computer.

For some time the solutions followed one another
but after a
while they began to depart
and eventually they bore no relation
to one another. He had discovered the <i>sensitivity to initial
conditions</i> that is perhaps the most salient feature of chaos.
He began simplifying his equations in an attempt to determine
the minimum conditions necessary for this bizarre behavior. The
result is the now famous <i>Lorenz equations</i>
which represent
the first example of a strange attractor arising from differential
equations

</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = s(<i>Y</i> - <i>X</i>)
</p><p>
(Eq. 6D)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>XZ</i> + <i>rX</i> - <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = <i>XY</i> - <i>bZ</i>
</p><p>
where s
<i>r</i>
and <i>b</i> are constants that Lorenz took
to be s = 10
<i>r</i> = 28
and <i>b</i> = 8/3. Lorenz published
his findings in 1963 in the <i>Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences</i>

where they went largely unnoticed for the next decade. The title
of his paper
"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow
" is an
apt description of what we now call "chaos."
</p><p>
Although the Lorenz equations were distilled from a model of
atmospheric convection
the trajectory in <i>XYZ</i>-space does
not represent air currents in any literal way. Instead
<i>X</i>
corresponds to the size of the connective motion
<i>Y</i> is
proportional to the temperature difference between the ascending
and descending fluids
and <i>Z</i> is proportional to the deviation
of the vertical temperature profile from a linear function. Nevertheless

the behavior is reminiscent of a fluid with turbulent convection.
</p><p>
Since the Lorenz equations were proposed
several phenomena have
been found that are at least approximately modeled by them. Perhaps
the simplest example is the thermosiphon. Imagine a continuous
tube
like a bicycle tube
filled with a liquid and mounted vertically.
If the bottom of the tube is heated and the top cooled
a convection
will ensue
with the warm fluid rising and the cold fluid falling.
The convection is equally likely to start in either direction.
After it starts
the circulation will continue in that direction
a few times around the loop and then abruptly reverse.
</p><p>
In the 1970's other examples of chaotic differential equations
began to be discovered. An important contribution was made in
1976 by Otto Rössler
a non-practicing medical doctor in
Germany. Rössler was interested in chaos in chemistry and
in theoretical biology
and he set about to find a system of equations
even simpler than those of Lorenz that exhibited chaotic behavior.
What he came up with are the now famous <i>Rössler equations</i>

</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = -(<i>Y</i> + <i>Z</i>)
</p><p>
(Eq. 6E)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = <i>X</i> + a<i>Y</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = b + <i>Z</i>(<i>X</i> - g)
</p><p>
where a
b
and g are constants that Rössler took to be a
= 0.2
b = 0.2
and g = 5.7. The Rössler equations constitute
the simplest known example of a system of ordinary differential
equations that exhibits chaos. They contain a single nonlinearity
(<i>ZX</i> in the third equation). Rössler's original paper
is also interesting because it contains a stereoscopic view of
his strange attractor as well as the Lorenz attractor.
</p><p>
Until very recently
the discovery of a new strange attractor
was a cause to rush to publication. With the program in this book

you can produce them by the thousands! Even today researchers
tend to focus on a few well-known examples such as the Lorenz
and Rössler attractors. An entire book has been written on
the Lorenz attractor alone. Think of the libraries that could
be filled by books describing your attractors in similar detail!
</p><p>
The Lorenz and Rössler attractors are shown in Figures 6-1
and 6-2
respectively
albeit with slightly different values of
the parameters than they used. These cases are known to have fractal
dimensions slightly greater than 2.0. These examples are more
important for their historical interest than for their visual
appeal. If you have never seen these attractors in 3-D
be sure
to return to these cases and view them with the various display
techniques after the program has been appropriately modified as
described in the next section. The Lorenz attractor resembles
the wings of a butterfly
making it an appropriate emblem of chaos

since the sensitivity to initial conditions is most dramatically
illustrated by the butterfly effect.</p><hr>

<b>6.3  Finite Differences</b>
</p><p>
Some differential equations
such as Equations 6A
can be solved
exactly in a straightforward manner using calculus. However
if
a system of equations exhibits chaos
no such solution is possible.
The reason is that there is no mathematical function analogous
to the sine and cosine that is capable of describing a strange
attractor the way those functions describe a circle. The equations
have to be solved by computer. We say that such solutions are
<i>numerical</i> as opposed to <i>analytical</i>.
</p><p>
Unfortunately
digital computers
which are ideal for iterating
maps
are inherently incapable of exactly solving differential
equations. The equations require that the solution advance slowly
and smoothly. That is to say
the successive iterates must differ
by an infinitesimal amount
and thus infinitely many iterations
are required to make any progress. There are special <i>analog
computers</i> designed for the task
but they are not common or
simple to program.
</p><p>
Books have been written on methods for the approximate numerical
solution of differential equations
and it is as much an art as
a science. All the methods involve in one form or other a <i>finite-difference</i>
approximation to the differential equation. Rather than take infinitesimal
steps
one advances in finite steps according to a prescription
that attempts to minimize the inevitable errors. Fortunately

for our purpose
it is not necessary that the solutions be highly
accurate
and so we can use a simple procedure.
</p><p>
Perhaps the easiest and most transparent method for finding approximate
solutions to differential equations is the<i> Euler</i> method.
When this procedure is applied to the simple example of Equations
6A
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are advanced according to
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>Xn</i> + e<i>Yn</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6F)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>Yn</i> - e<i>Xn</i>
</p><p>
where e is the time step that ideally should be negligibly small

but in reality is made as large as possible to reduce the number
of iterations required to advance the solution by a substantial
distance along the trajectory. You see that the Euler method is
just another example of an iterated map in which successive iterates
are near one another. It is perhaps the least accurate method
for solving differential equations
and it is easily improved
upon. However
for most of our purposes
the Euler method is adequate.
Furthermore
it is simple to modify the program to solve differential
equations by this method. The necessary changes are shown in the
listing <b>PROG21</b>.

<p>
In <b>PROG21</b>
the value of e has been taken as 0.1
and the
three-dimensional equations are taken to be polynomials up to
fifth order with coefficients chosen by analogy to the three-dimensional
polynomial maps previously described. We don't consider differential
equations in less than three dimensions since they cannot have
chaotic solutions. The second-order through fifth-order equations
are coded with the first letters Q
R
S
and T
respectively.
</p><p>
If e is sufficiently small
its value should not affect whether
a system is chaotic or the general appearance of the attractor

but it will certainly change the trajectory on the attractor.
Just as a chaotic trajectory is sensitive to initial conditions

it is also sensitive to the approximations used to calculate it.
Unfortunately
a value of e = 0.1 is not sufficiently small
and
many of the resulting attractors would disappear or change their
appearance if e were reduced. Conversely
other attractors would
emerge for smaller values of e. Fortunately
for our purposes

it is not necessary that the solutions be even qualitatively correct.
You should be forewarned that reducing e will have unpredictable
effects on the attractors and that the computation time will increase.
</p><p>
The Lyapunov exponent is calculated as with the corresponding
maps except that it is divided by e so that its units are bits
per second
rather than bits per iteration
since each iteration
advances the solution by e seconds. It is customary to express
the Lyapunov exponent in this way for differential equations since
the step size depends upon the numerical approximation that is
being used
whereas the divergence of the trajectories per unit
time is an intrinsic property of the differential equations.

Sample attractors produced by three-dimensional ordinary differential
equations projected onto the <i>XY</i>-plane are shown in Figures
6-3 through 6-6.</p><hr>

The preceding figures are like time-exposed photographs of the
shadow on the wall of a fly moving chaotically in a room. However

because of the finite difference approximation used to solve the
equation of motion
you must imagine that the fly is illuminated
by a strobe lamp that flashes rapidly. The trajectory thus consists
of a large number of closely spaced dots. The separation of the
dots provides a measure of the accuracy of the solution. Although
some of the cases produce apparently continuous trajectories

others more nearly resemble the maps of the previous chapters.
You might prefer to alter the program so that the dots are connected
by lines.
</p><p>
Another consequence of dealing with differential equations is
that many iterations are required for the solution to settle onto
the attractor. Since we use the same criterion for the number
of iterations as we did for the maps
a significant number (perhaps
20 percent) of the attractors found in a random search are not
chaotic
and a few are even unbounded. When you evaluate the attractors
found by the search
you will recognize these cases by the way
they eventually settle onto a simple closed curve that is visually
indistinguishable from a limit cycle
spiral into a fixed point

or leave the screen. You will also notice a few cases that consist
of isolated islands with no bridge connecting them
such as the
one in <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig6-03.gif">Figure 6-3</a>. You can be sure these are not true flows
since
such discontinuities are impossible in the trajectories that arise
from the solution of differential equations.
</p><p>
There is no reason to limit the display of attractors arising
from differential equations to projections onto a plane. All the
display techniques developed in Chapter 4 for three-dimensional
maps are also available here. Figures 6-7 through 6-22 and Plates
23 and 24 show a selection of such examples.</p><hr>

<b>6.5  Strange Attractors that Aren't</b>
</p><p>
In Section 3.8 we discussed chaotic orbits that don't approach
an attractor (Strange Attractors that Don't). Here we consider
non-chaotic orbits that approach attractors that aren't strange.
These attractors are not fractals. They have dimensions that are
integers such as 0
1
2
or 3. Some of them are beautiful
and
thus they are worth displaying even if they are technically outside
the scope of this book.
</p><p>
Such attractors can arise from maps as well as from differential
equations. They don't require high embedding dimensions
although
the dimension of the attractor will always be at least one less
than the dimension of the embedding space. Thus some of the examples
are taken from equations described in earlier chapters.
</p><p>
The simplest non-chaotic attractor is a point attractor. Suppose
we modified Equations 6A so that the solution was not a circle
but an inward spiral. One way to do this is as follows:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i> - <i>bX</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6G)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> - <i>bY</i>
</p><p>
You can think of the coefficient <i>b</i> as a measure of the
friction that eventually brings the trajectory to rest at the
origin (<i>X</i> = <i>Y</i> = 0) in phase space. If <i>b</i> is
zero (frictionless)
the orbit is a circle. Negative values of
<i>b</i> (anti-friction) cause the solution to spiral outward

approaching infinity. This case corresponds to a point repellor
at the origin.
</p><p>
The two occurrences of <i>b</i> in Equations 6G need not have
the same value or even the same sign. In such a case
the orbit
spirals in or out but not in a perfectly symmetrical manner. Many
physical processes have <i>b</i> = 0 in one of the equations.
If <i>b</i> is close to zero
it doesn't matter much in which
equation it appears.
</p><p>
Small positive values of <i>b</i> cause the radius of the circle
to decrease slowly
approaching what is called a <i>spiral-point
</i>or<i> focal-point attractor</i>
or simply a <i>focus</i>.
Larger positive values of <i>b</i> cause the radius to decrease
more rapidly. With very large values of <i>b</i>
there is little
circulation around the point
and the trajectory is more nearly
radial toward what is called a <i>radial-point</i> or <i>nodal-point
attractor</i>
or simply a <i>node</i>. The boundary between the
two cases corresponds to <i>critical damping</i> in an oscillator.
In either case
the resulting attractor is a point at the origin
with a dimension of zero. A code that produces a point attractor
(with <i>b</i> = 1) is QMLM3NM5LM3LM14.
</p><p>
The above case has a negative value of the largest Lyapunov exponent
(<i>L</i> = - 0.14)
and it produces a single dot on the screen.
More interesting cases can occur because the program assumes the
trajectory is on the attractor after 1000 iterations. For trajectories
that approach the attractor very slowly
there can be interesting
behavior after the thousandth iteration and before the fixed point
is reached. Such slowly attracting fixed points have Lyapunov
exponents very close to zero. The search can be expanded to include
them
as well as other non-chaotic attractors
by changing the
.005 in line 2480 of the program to -.005
for example. Then attractors
with Lyapunov exponents near zero but which have not settled to
a fixed point after <i>NMAX</i> iterations will be included in
the file <b>SA.DIC</b>. If you prefer
you can collect them in
a separate file <b>TORUS.DIC</b> by changing line 4910 of <b>PROG21</b>
to
</p><p>
4910 IF L &gt; .005 THEN OPEN "SA.DIC" FOR APPEND AS
#1 ELSE OPEN "TORUS.DIC" FOR APPEND AS #1
</p><p>
Several such cases are shown in Figures 6-39 through 6-42. Figure
6-39 shows a spiral-point attractor. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig6-40.gif">Figure 6-40</a> shows what appears
to be a radial-point attractor with several different initial
conditions but which is really a spiral-point attractor with successive
iterates that move rapidly around the fixed point. This phenomenon
is called <i>aliasing</i>
and it is most easily detected by connecting
temporally successive points with continuous lines. Figures 6-41
and 6-42 show cases where the rate of circulation around the fixed
point changes significantly as the fixed point is approached.

<b><a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig6-42.gif">Figure 6-42</a>. Trajectory Approaching a Point Attractor</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>The point attractor is the simplest type of non-chaotic
attractor. It has a dimension of zero. An attractor can also have
a dimension of one
which is a line. Such attractors are limit
cycles. They correspond to systems that settle into a periodic
or cyclic behavior. Consequently
such attractors are also called
<i>cyclic attractors</i>.
</p><p>
The simplest differential equations that produce a cyclic trajectory
are Equations 6A. The resulting orbit is a circle in the <i>XY</i>-plane.
This case is not an attractor
however
because every initial
condition produces a circular trajectory whose radius is the distance
of the initial point from the origin. There is no unique circle
to which nearby orbits are attracted
and there is no basin of
attraction. Furthermore
if you attempt to display the trajectory
using a code such as QM5NM5LM18
you will find that the orbit
is unbounded and spirals outward as if there were a point repellor
at the origin. The reason is that our iteration scheme for approximating
the solution of the differential equations is not exact. The errors
compound and eventually cause the orbit to be lost.
</p><p>
The simple undamped (frictionless) oscillator is said to be <i>structurally
unstable</i> because an arbitrarily small perturbation to the
equation (such as using the finite difference approximation of
Equation 6F) changes the structure of the solution from a closed
loop to a never-ending spiral. Note the distinction between an
unstable <i>equation</i>
in which a small modification of the
equation causes a large change in the solution
and an unstable
<i>solution</i>
in which a small variation of the initial condition
away from the equilibrium value causes the solution to move ever
farther from equilibrium.
</p><p>
To produce a true limit cycle that is structurally stable
we
need a system of equations whose solutions spiral outward from
initial conditions in the interior and spiral inward from initial
conditions on the exterior of the attractor. A suitable set of
such equations is the following:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i> + (1 - <i>X</i>2 - <i>Y</i>2)<i>X</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6H)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> + (1 - <i>X</i>2 - <i>Y</i>2)<i>Y</i>
</p><p>
The quantity (1 - <i>X</i>2 - <i>Y</i>2) plays the role of -<i>b</i>
in Equations 6G. Whenever the trajectory lies inside the circle
of radius one
it spirals outward
and whenever it lies outside
the circle of radius one
it spirals inward. Thus the limit cycle
is defined by the circle <i>X</i>2 + <i>Y</i>2 = 1. There is a
point repellor at the origin
and the basin of attraction is the
entire <i>XY</i>-plane. A code that produces such a stable limit
cycle
except with a smaller radius is RMNMAM3AM3NM9LM2AM6NMAM26.
</p><p>
A limit cycle may be either stable or unstable
just like a fixed
point. With an unstable limit cycle
nearby orbits move progressively
farther from the limit cycle. An unstable limit cycle can be identified
in an invertable map or system of ordinary differential equations
by running time backwards
in which case the limit cycle becomes
stable and attracts rather than repels nearby orbits.
</p><p>
A slightly simpler version of Equations 6H that produces a stable
limit cycle
although not a symmetrical one
is the following:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6I)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> + (1 - <i>X</i>2)<i>Y</i>
</p><p>
This system is called the <i>Van der Pol equation</i>
and it
was first used to model vacuum-tube oscillator circuits
but it
has been used in other applications such as the modeling of pulsating
stars called <i>Cephids</i>. A code for the Van der Pol equation
is RM11OM9KM2KM6OM28.
</p><p>
Such limit cycles are characterized by a dimension of one and
a Lyapunov exponent of zero. The dimension as approximated by
the program will usually not be exactly 1.0 for the reasons discussed
in Section 3.4. The Lyapunov exponent is a much better criterion
for identifying limit cycles. In a two-dimensional embedding space
as in the above examples
there are two Lyapunov exponents. The
smaller (more negative) of them is the rate at which trajectories
with different initial conditions approach the attractor. The
larger exponent (the one calculated by the program) is the rate
at which two nearby points on the limit cycle separate. For the
attractor to be non-chaotic (not strange)
this exponent must
be zero.
</p><p>
In two dimensions
the limit cycles cannot cross
and so the
most complicated shapes are simple distorted loops. In three or
more dimensions
they can wrap around in a complicated tangle
like a ball of string
but without ends. Figures 6-43 through
6-50 show a collection of visually interesting limit cycles. They
are plotted as stereo pairs so that you can see how the trajectories
pass beneath one another.
</p><p>
As you examine the figures
you will note that some of the limit
cycles
such as the one in Figure 6-43
form knots. You cannot
straighten them out into circular loops. By contrast Figure 6-47
is unknotted. This <i>knottedness</i> or <i>helicity</i> is an
important topological property of an attractor. Some processes
in nature tend to conserve helicity
just as mechanical energy
is conserved in frictionless motion. Thus when some parameter
of the system is changed
the limit cycle may change its size
and shape but in such a way that it always links itself in the
same way. An example is a magnetic field line in a turbulent conducting
fluid such as a <i>plasma</i> of electrically charged particles.
</p><p>
For many of the limit cycles exhibited here
it is very hard
to tell whether they are knotted. Even when they appear to be
knotted
it is hard to tell whether two cases are knotted in the
same way. Such patterns might provide a useful psychological test
for one's spatial acuity since they require both depth perception
and a mental dexterity to visualize their shape when untangled
as much as possible. See which of the limit cycles in the figures
you think are knotted.</p><hr>

Non-chaotic attractors can be points or lines. They can also
be surfaces. Surfaces are two-dimensional manifolds. Perhaps the
simplest set of equations whose solution is a trajectory that
fills a surface is the following:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6J)
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = <i>aW</i>
</p><p>
<i>W'</i> = -<i>Z</i>
</p><p>
You will recognize the first two equations as the same as Equations
6A that produce a circle in the <i>XY</i>-plane. The second two
equations produce an ellipse in the <i>ZW</i>-plane. The two motions
are <i>uncoupled</i> (<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> don't depend on <i>Z</i>
or <i>W</i>; <i>Z</i> and <i>W</i> don't depend on <i>X</i> or
<i>Y</i>). The parameter <i>a</i> is the square of the angular
frequency of the second motion. If the square root of <i>a</i>
is a <i>rational</i> number (a ratio of two integers) the trajectory
is a closed one-dimensional loop in the four-dimensional embedding
space.
</p><p>
If the square root of <i>a</i> is irrational
the trajectory
fills a two-dimensional toroidal surface (called a <i>2-torus</i>).
The trajectory winds endlessly around the surface of a dougnut

never intersecting itself. In such a case we say the frequencies
(the number of transits per second the long way around and the
short way around) are <i>incommensurate</i>
and that the trajectory
is <i>quasi-periodic</i>. The sequence never repeats
but it is
not chaotic. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between
quasi-periodic and chaotic behavior.
</p><p>
A useful tool for distinguishing between a quasi-periodic and
a chaotic attractor is the <i>power spectrum</i> of the time series

which will have sharp peaks at discrete frequencies for quasi-periodic
trajectories but a broad (continuous) spectrum for chaotic trajectories.
The power spectrum contains about half of the information required
to reconstruct the trajectory; the frequency information is present

but the phase information is lost. Nevertheless
the power spectrum
serves as a kind of fingerprint that is very useful in categorizing
attractors.
</p><p>
Equations 6J have the same problems as Equations 6A. They don't
represent an attractor since nearly all initial conditions produce
different tori. Furthermore
the tori produced in this way are
structurally unstable
just like the circles of Equations 6A.
These difficulties can be circumvented by using instead an extension
of Equations 6H to produce two uncoupled limit cycles as follows:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i> + (1 - <i>X</i>2 - <i>Y</i>2)<i>X</i>
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> + (1 - <i>X</i>2 - <i>Y</i>2)<i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 6K)
</p><p>
<i>Z</i> = <i>aW</i> + (1 - <i>Z</i>2 - <i>W</i>2)<i>Z</i>
</p><p>
<i>W</i> = -<i>Z</i> + (1 - <i>Z</i>2 - <i>W</i>2)<i>W</i>
</p><p>
A value of <i>a</i> = 2 provides an acceptable irrational frequency
ratio
since the square root of 2 cannot be represented as a ratio
of two integers. The corresponding trajectory can be generated
using the code VMNMAM4AM7NM19LM2AM11NMAM42NMAM2AOM28LM2AM2NMA.
A rotated version of the 2-torus in which one loop is in the <i>XZ</i>-plane
and the other is in the <i>YW</i>-plane is produced by the code
VMNMAM8AM13NM24NMAM6AM6OM3LM3AM20NMAM22LM3AM11NMA.
</p><p>
Two uncoupled limit cycles lie on a torus that is attractive

but it is not technically an attractor; it is called an <i>invariant
manifold</i>. For an object to be an attractor
it must not only
attract nearby trajectories
but most trajectories on it must
wander all over it
in which case we say the set is <i>transitive</i>
and the orbits are <i>ergodic</i>. Ergodic orbits produce <i>mixing</i>

which means that an orbit starting from anywhere on the attractor
will eventually come arbitrarily close to every other point on
the attractor. Mixing ensures that an attractor cannot be split
into two different attractors
although the attractor need not
be <i>connected</i>. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig5-11.gif">Figure 5-11</a> shows an attractor that is not
connected. Thus not all attractive tori are attractors
just as
not all attractors are tori.
</p><p>
Tori can be identified in the computer search by a Lyapunov exponent
close to zero and a dimension well above one. It is easy to distinguish
them visually from limit cycles
which can also have Lyapunov
exponents close to zero but which resemble lines rather than surfaces.
A selection of tori projected onto the <i>XY</i>-plane is shown
in Figures 6-51 through 6-60.</p><hr>

<b> </b>Most of the attractors shown in the figures look like
tori in the sense that you can see or imagine the hole in the
doughnut. However
it is important to understand that
just as
not all limit cycles are circles
not all 2-tori look like doughnuts.
They are topologically equivalent in the sense that there is a
"rubber-sheet" deformation (called a <i>homeomorphism</i>)
that maps them into a doughnut. A coffee cup
for example
is
topologically equivalent to a doughnut as long as the handle is
unbroken.
</p><p>
Those cases that are not obviously equivalent to a simple torus
are distorted by the fact that they are viewed projected onto
the <i>XY</i>-plane or because they are rotated at an awkward
angle. Also note that most of these tori are embedded in a four-dimensional
space
and thus it is even more difficult to grasp their shape
from a two-dimensional projection. You might wish to display them
using some of the advanced visualization techniques provided by
the program.
</p><p>
It is possible
though difficult
to produce a <i>3-torus</i>
in a four-dimensional embedding space. A 3-torus is a generalization
of a 2-torus. It is hard to visualize. It involves three mutually
incommensurate frequencies. It is characterized by a dimension
of three and a largest Lyapunov exponent of zero. Some of the
attractors in the figures seem to be 3-tori according to their
calculated dimension. However
the calculation is not sufficiently
precise to distinguish unambiguously between a 2-torus and a 3-torus.
It is necessary to search embedding dimensions greater than four
to have a good chance of finding 3-tori.
</p><p>
Dynamical systems whose trajectories lie on a 3-torus or other
hypertori of even higher dimensions are difficult to observe in
nature. The reason is that such attractors can be perturbed by
an arbitrarily small change to the system that causes them to
become strange attractors. According to <i>Peixoto's theorem</i>
(which strictly applies only to compact
orientable manifolds)

2-tori tend to be structurally stable while 3-tori and higher
are structurally unstable. Thus it appears that complicated deterministic
systems that exhibit nontrivial behavior are well represented
by the strange attractors that constitute the subject of this
book.
</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 7</b>
</p><p>
<b>Further Fascinating Functions</b>
</p><p>
For a system of equations to exhibit chaos
the equations must
contain at least one nonlinear term
that is
a term that is not
simply proportional to one of the variables. In all the preceding
examples
the nonlinearity involved simple polynomials. Such polynomials
are capable of modeling an enormous variety of physical phenomena.
Virtually all nonlinear functions can be approximated by polynomials
with sufficiently many terms. However
by limiting the polynomials
to fifth order
we have missed many interesting possibilities.
In this chapter we will examine a few of these possibilities and
suggest others that you might wish to explore on your own.
</p><p>
<b>7.1  Steps and Tents</b>
</p><p>
Perhaps the simplest nonlinear function is the <i>absolute value</i>

which is denoted by |<i>X</i>| and programmed in BASIC with the
command ABS(<i>X</i>). The absolute value of <i>X</i> is the magnitude
of <i>X</i> without regard to its sign. For example
if <i>X</i>
is -6 then |<i>X</i>| is 6. It is a nonlinear function because
a graph of |<i>X</i>| versus <i>X</i> is a V-shaped curve with
its notch at the origin rather than a straight line as would result
if |<i>X</i>| were proportional to <i>X</i>. By adding linear
terms
the V can be rotated to resemble an L or a staircase step.
Computers can evaluate ABS(<i>X</i>) very quickly
since they
only need to discard the sign.
</p><p>
An example of a one-dimensional chaotic map that involves |<i>X</i>|
is the <i>tent map</i>
so called because its graph is an inverted
V. A tent map that maps the interval -1 to 1 back onto itself
is
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = 1 - 2|<i>Xn</i>|          (Eq. 7A)
</p><p>
The behavior of Equation 7A is very similar to the behavior of
the logistic equation (Equation 1C) with <i>R</i> = 4
which maps
the interval 0 to 1 back onto itself. A mapping that returns a
set onto itself is called an <i>endomorphism</i>.
</p><p>
Since one-dimensional maps tend not to be very interesting visually

we will generalize Equation 7A to two dimensions as follows:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>4|<i>Xn</i>| + <i>a</i>5|<i>Yn</i>|
</p><p>
(Eq. 7B)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>6 + <i>a</i>7<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>8<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>9|<i>Xn</i>| + <i>a</i>10|<i>Yn</i>|
</p><p>
This form is analogous to the general two-dimensional quadratic
map in Equations 3B.
</p><p>
To make things a little more interesting
we can add two more
dimensions (<i>Z</i> and <i>W</i>) to take advantage of the visualization
techniques that have been previously developed. However
to keep
things simple we will demand that <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> don't
depend on <i>Z</i> or <i>W</i>. They are just along for the ride

so to speak. The dynamical behavior will be determined only by
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. We can choose any convenient equation for
<i>Z</i> and for <i>W</i>. One possibility is to evaluate <i>Z</i>
from <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> according to
</p><p>
<i>Zn</i>+1 = <i>Xn</i>2 + <i>Yn</i>2          (Eq. 7C)
</p><p>
Thus <i>Z</i> is the square of the distance of the previous iterate
from the origin. You might want to experiment with other forms.
</p><p>
For the fourth dimension (<i>W</i>)
we will do something completely
different. We will arrange for <i>W</i> to increase linearly with
the iteration number. Thus <i>W</i> becomes the time coordinate
in four-dimensional space-time.
</p><p>
The program modifications required to extend the computer search
to such cases are shown in the listing <b>PROG22</b>. Codes for
this case begin with the letter Y.

representations for the first time on your computer screen. Note
that these attractors differ from the cases produced by polynomials
in that they tend to have sharp angular corners. The one in Figure

but is an example of an area-preserving

<b>7.2  ANDs and ORs</b>
</p><p>
A very different type of nonlinear map can be produced using
logical (<i>Boolean</i>) operations to manipulate the individual
bits of the binary numbers that represent the variables. This
is best done after rounding the variables to the nearest integer
using the BASIC CINT function. As a variation
you could use the
FIX or INT functions
which truncate rather than round. Most versions
of BASIC automatically apply the CINT function before performing
logical operations on numbers that are not integers. The conversion
of a non-integer to an integer is itself a nonlinear operation
since the graph of CINT(<i>X</i>) versus <i>X</i> would resemble
a staircase.
</p><p>
The basic logical operators are AND and OR. If you are not sure
what these operations mean
your BASIC manual is a good reference.
The operation <i>X</i> AND <i>Y</i> produces a new number whose
bits are 1 if the corresponding bits of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
are both 1
and 0 otherwise. The operation <i>X</i> OR <i>Y</i>
produces a new number whose bits are 1 if either (or both) of
the corresponding bits of <i>X</i> or <i>Y</i> are 1
and 0 otherwise.
This is also called the <i>inclusive</i> OR to distinguish it
from the <i>exclusive</i> OR (XOR)

arising presumably
from rounding the variables to integers before performing the

<b>7.3  Roots and Powers</b>
</p><p>
Polynomial maps involve powers of the variables that are small
positive integers
such as the square (2) and the cube (3). Polynomials
exclude nonlinearities such as the square root or the reciprocal
of the variables. Roots and powers are mathematically equivalent
except for the size of the exponent. The square root of <i>X</i>
can be written as <i>X</i>0.5
and the reciprocal of <i>X</i>
can be written as 1/<i>X</i> or as <i>X</i>-1. It is interesting
to examine strange attractors that involve fractional and negative
powers.
</p><p>
A general two-dimensional system of equations that involves arbitrary
powers is the following:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>4|<i>Xn</i>|<i>a</i>5 + <i>a</i>6|<i>Yn</i>|<i>a</i>7
</p><p>
(Eq. 7E)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>8 + <i>a</i>9<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>10<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>11|<i>Xn</i>|<i>a</i>12 + <i>a</i>13|<i>Yn</i>|<i>a</i>14
</p><p>
The absolute values are needed because BASIC cannot take a root
of a negative number. The result would have an imaginary component.
Note that if all the exponents happen to be +1
Equations 7E are
equivalent to Equations 7B. The third and fourth dimensions are
determined in the same way as in Section 7.1.
</p><p>
The program modifications required to extend the computer search
to such cases are shown in the listing <b>PROG24</b>. Since we
have exhausted the capital letter codes
it is necessary to invent
some new ones. We will continue using the standard ASCII characters
beyond Z as shown in Table 2.1. Thus the codes for this case will
begin with the left bracket ([)
which is ASCII 91.

<p>
Examples of attractors produced by <b>PROG24</b> are shown in
Figures 7-17 through 7-24. These attractors are localized mostly
to a small region of the <i>XY</i>-plane with tentacles that stretch
out to large distances. If any of the exponents are negative and
the attractor intersects the line along which the respective variable
is zero
a point on the line will map to infinity. However
large
values are visited infrequently by the orbit
and so many iterations
are required to determine that the orbit is unbounded. For this
reason most of the attractors in the figures have holes in their
interior where the orbit is precluded from coming too close to
the origin (<i>X</i> = <i>Y</i> = 0).
</p><p>
You may become frustrated to see a beautiful attractor develop
for thousands of iterations
and then to have the orbit escape.
Such behavior is called a <i>crisis</i> or <i>transient chaos</i>

not to be confused with a <i>catastrophe</i>. For example
the
logistic equation with <i>R</i> slightly greater than 4.0 is chaotic
for many iterations until an iterate happens to exceed 1.0
whereupon
the orbit abruptly moves off toward infinity.  By contrast
a
<i>catastrophe</i> occurs when the solution undergoes a qualitative
change at some critical value of a control parameter.
</p><p>
Related to a crisis is another phenomenon called <i>intermittency</i>.
At certain values of the control parameters
a system will exhibit
periodic behavior for many cycles and then will suddenly become
chaotic for a while before settling back into periodic behavior.
Classic examples of intermittency occur in the logistic equation
at about <i>R</i> = 3.82812 and in the Lorenz equations at about
<i>r</i> = 166.2. Intermittency has been observed in many natural
systems
and it is a bane to those who try to make predictions.
It is possible that the solar system is intermittently chaotic

or even that a crisis could occur leading to a complete loss of
its stability
perhaps precipitated by a rare conjunction of a
planet with a large asteroid or comet.
</p><p>
Those solutions of Equations 7E that remain bounded tend to have
a wispy appearance and to go beyond the frame of the figure because
of the occasional large excursions. Artistically
this feature
gives the attractors a sense of being connected to the surrounding
world rather than being isolated objects suspended in a void.
If you frame these cases
a surrounding mat is desirable to provide
the illusion that they are being viewed through a window.</p><hr>

<b>7.4  Sines and Cosines</b>
</p><p>
One of the most common nonlinear function is the sine
and its
complement
the cosine. The sine and cosine can be approximated
by polynomials as follows:
</p><p>
sin <i>X</i> = <i>X</i> - <i>X</i>3/6 + <i>X</i>5 /120 - <i>X</i>7/5040
+ ...
</p><p>
(Eq. 7F)
</p><p>
cos <i>X</i> = 1 - <i>X</i>2/2 + <i>X</i>4/24 - <i>X</i>6/720
+ ...
</p><p>
When the argument <i>X</i> is small
the approximations are very
accurate using only a few terms in the expansion. The denominator
of each term is the <i>factorial</i> of the exponent of that term.
For example
the factorial of five (written 5!) is equal to 5
x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. When <i>X</i> is large
many terms are
required. In such a case we would expect to observe dynamics different
from those produced by the fifth-order polynomials previously
examined.
</p><p>
A general two-dimensional system of equations whose nonlinearity
is restricted to the sine function is the following:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>1 + <i>a</i>2<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>4sin(<i>a</i>5<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>6) + <i>a</i>7sin(<i>a</i>8<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>9)
</p><p>
(Eq. 7G)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = <i>a</i>10 + <i>a</i>11<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>12<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>13sin(<i>a</i>14<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>15) + <i>a</i>16sin(<i>a</i>17<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>18)
</p><p>
It is not necessary to consider separately the cosine because
the <i>phase</i> terms (<i>a</i>6
<i>a</i>9
<i>a</i>15
and
<i>a</i>18) have the same effect since cos <i>X</i> is equal to
sin(<i>X</i> + ¹/2). The third and fourth dimensions are
determined in the same way as in Section 7.1.

to such cases are shown in the listing <b>PROG25</b>. These cases
will be coded with the backslash (\)

In this section we will consider a special type of map that involves
sines and cosines. The solutions are chaotic
but they are not
attractors. The systems they describe are Hamiltonian. Such Hamiltonian
systems obey the <i>Liouville theorem</i>
which states that the
phase-space volume occupied by a set of points will be conserved
as the system evolves in time. Thus the orbit will eventually
return arbitrarily close to an initial condition. Contrast this
to dissipative systems in which the phase-space volume decreases
in time
eventually collapsing all initial conditions within the
basin of attraction onto the attractor. In dissipative systems

the basin of attraction is usually much larger than the attractor.
The equations are as follows:
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = 10<i>a</i>1 + [<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>2sin(<i>a</i>3<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>4)]cos a + <i>Yn </i>sin a
</p><p>
(Eq. 7H)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = 10<i>a</i>5 - [<i>Xn</i> + <i>a</i>2sin(<i>a</i>3<i>Yn</i>
+ <i>a</i>4)]sin a + <i>Yn </i>cos a
</p><p>
where a = 2¹ / (13 + 10<i>a</i>6). The third and fourth dimensions
are determined in the same way as in Section 7.1.
</p><p>
The special form of Equations 7H not only guarantees that the
solution is area-preserving
but that it has circular symmetry.
Furthermore
there is an inherent periodicity that arises from
the fact that a is 2¹ divided by an integer that ranges from
1 to 25. The periodicity is indicated by the last letter of the
code (<i>a</i>6): A for period-1
B for period-2
and so forth.
Because of the circular symmetry and infinite extent
it is interesting
to project these cases onto a sphere using the <b>P</b> command.
</p><p>
The program modifications required to extend the computer search
to such cases are shown in the listing <b>PROG26</b>. These cases
will be coded with the right bracket (])
which is ASCII 93.

<p>
As you watch the patterns develop
you will see the orbit wander
throughout the <i>XY</i>-plane along a network of channels. The
network is infinite in extent and is called a <i>stochastic web</i>.
The global wandering is evidence of <i>minimal chaos</i>
and
it causes the orbit eventually to leave the boundary of the computer
screen. If you interrupt the calculation at some point
the resulting
structure resembles a wreath or a snowflake. The infinite structure
is a <i>tiling</i>
but its symmetry is slightly spoiled by the
finite thickness of the web. This breaking of the symmetry eliminates
the monotony and contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the patterns.
</p><p>
The slow wandering of the orbit throughout the web is an example
of <i>Arnol'd diffusion</i>
which is named after the Russian
mathematician Vladimir Arnol'd. Normally we associate diffusion
with a random process in which
for example
the molecules of
a gas move slowly from one region to another by countless collisions
with other molecules. The presence of diffusion in such simple
deterministic systems has many practical consequences such as
providing a means for heating a gas of electrically charged particles
(a plasma) in a magnetic field using electromagnetic waves.
</p><p>
These stochastic webs contain circular chains of islands
or
beads on a necklace
if you prefer a different analogy
whose
interior contains periodic orbits. Surrounding the islands is
a stochastic sea in which the orbits are chaotic and connected
to all other points in the sea. You will also note that the Lyapunov
exponents are small. Since the orbits diffuse slowly in the sea

nearby orbits remain close together for many iterations. For a
similar reason
the calculated fractal dimension is lower than
it should be. Recall that the dimension calculation is based on
the previous 500 iterates
whose values tend to be nearly equal
in this case.
</p><p>
Examples of stochastic webs produced by <b>PROG26</b> are shown
in Figures 7-33 through 7-40. These cases
because of the slow
diffusion of the orbit
provide a good opportunity to exhibit
the time variation with colors as shown in Plates 31 and 32. You
may wish to try different values of <i>NMAX%</i> in line 1050
to control the rate at which the colors change. Web maps provide
a perfect illustration of how chaos and determinism coexist. The
underlying symmetry of the equations is evident in the figures

but the orbit exhibits apparently random motion within the chaotic
region.</p><hr>

<b>7.6  Swings and Springs</b>
</p><p>
All the previous examples of maps and differential equations
in this book share the property that the right-hand side of the
equations is independent of the iteration number (<i>N</i>) or
time (<i>t</i>). Such equations are called <i>autonomous</i>.
For a given set of initial conditions
they produce the same solution
for whatever time or iteration number they are started.
</p><p>
Some important physical processes are most conveniently expressed
by <i>non-autonomous</i> equations. An example is a driven (forced)

damped
linear
harmonic oscillator
which is described by the
following equations:
</p><p>
<i>X' </i>= <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 7I)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> - <i>bY</i> + <i>A</i> sin w<i>t</i>
</p><p>
In Equations 7I
<i>b</i> is the damping constant (friction)

<i>A</i> is the amplitude of the drive (forcing) function
and
w is the angular frequency (radians per second) of the drive.
The friction force is assumed to be proportional and opposite
to the velocity (-<i>Y</i>)
although other forms give qualitatively
similar results. This type of friction is called <i>linear damping</i>.
</p><p>
The usual trick for dealing with non-autonomous equations is
to introduce an additional variable (say <i>Z</i>) and rewrite
Equations 7I
for example
as
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 7J)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> - <i>bY</i> + <i>A</i> sin <i>Z</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = w
</p><p>
Equations 7J contain a nonlinearity (sin <i>Z</i>)
but they do
not have chaotic solutions. The solution (for positive <i>b</i>)
is a limit cycle with frequency w. The limit cycle is largest
when the damping is small (<i>b</i> much less than 1) and w is
1
corresponding to <i>resonance</i>.
</p><p>
To obtain interesting chaotic solutions
we need additional nonlinear
terms. We will restrict these nonlinearities to odd polynomials
(<i>X</i>
<i>X</i>3
<i>X</i>2<i>Y</i>
and so forth) in the
second equation to preserve the symmetry of the oscillation. A
general form with odd polynomials up to order 3 is as follows:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>a</i>1<i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 7K)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = <i>a</i>2<i>X</i> + <i>a</i>3<i>X</i>3 + <i>a</i>4<i>X</i>2<i>Y</i>
+ <i>a</i>5<i>XY</i>2 + <i>a</i>6<i>Y</i> + <i>a</i>7<i>Y</i>3
+ <i>a</i>8sin <i>Z</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = <i>a</i>9 + 1.3
</p><p>
If the product <i>a</i>1<i>a</i>2 is negative
these equations
represent the motion of a mass oscillating on a nonlinear spring
or a pendulum swinging through a large angle (but not going over
the top). If <i>a</i>3/<i>a</i>2 is positive
the spring gets
stiffer when stretched or compressed (<i>hard spring</i>). If
<i>a</i>3/<i>a</i>2 is negative
the spring gets weaker when stretched
or compressed (<i>soft</i> <i>spring</i>). If <i>a</i>3/<i>a</i>2
is -1/6
the solution approximates a vigorously swinging pendulum.
If the product <i>a</i>1<i>a</i>2 is positive and <i>a</i>3/<i>a</i>2
is negative
the system models a buckled beam and is called the
<i>Duffing two-well oscillator</i>. The final combination (<i>a</i>1<i>a</i>2
and <i>a</i>3/<i>a</i>2 both positive) is unstable and has an
unbounded solution.
</p><p>
In Equations 7K we can exploit the fact that <i>Z</i> enters
only through the term sin <i>Z</i>
and thus it is periodic with
period 2p. Whenever <i>Z</i> exceeds 2p
we can subtract 2p from
it without changing the result. This trick keeps <i>Z</i> bounded
in the range 0 to 2p rather than letting it march off to infinity
as it would otherwise do. The <i>Z</i>-coordinate then becomes
the <i>phase angle</i> of the drive function. Note that the MOD
function in most versions of BASIC works correctly only on integer
variables
and thus it should not be used for the above purpose.
The +1.3 term in the <i>Z</i>-equation ensures that the phase
angle always increases in time for -1.2 &lt; <i>a</i>9 &lt; 1.2.
The fourth variable (<i>W</i>) is proportional to time as in the
previous examples.

These cases provide an ideal opportunity to animate the third
dimension (drive phase). If you have not fanned through the figures
in the upper right-hand corner of the odd pages of the book
do
so now. Be sure to fan in the forward direction (low to high page
numbers). These figures were produced using sixty-four phase slices
of the attractor ^VYGJBPIJN with ten million iterations.
</p><p>
You will see several cycles of stretching and folding. Note that
there are three diagonal bands that run from the lower left to
the upper right of the attractor. The three bands are stretched
and compressed into a single band
while two additional bands
enter first from the upper left and then from the lower right.
Thus one of the three bands consists of three smaller bands
one
of which consists of three even smaller bands
and so forth. Such
an infinitely layered band is called a <i>thick line</i> or a
<i>Cantor one-manifold</i>. Viewed in three dimensions
the thick
line would appear as a <i>thick surface</i> or a <i>Cantor two-manifold</i>.
There is perhaps no clearer illustration anywhere in this book
of the way strange attractors are formed and acquire their fractal
micro-structure.

<b>7.7  Roll Your Own</b>
</p><p>
Perhaps this is a good place to leave you with this brief taste
of the immense variety of nonlinear functions and equations
nearly
all of which admit strange attractors that can be identified and
examined using the technique described in this book. The possibilities
are limited only by your imagination
and you can be assured that
nearly every strange attractor that you discover will never have
been seen before. There surely exist classes of objects yet to
be discovered that are of mathematical and artistic interest.
</p><p>
If you decide to pursue such an exploration
you might start
with some of the other nonlinear functions and operators that
are built into the BASIC language. Table 7.1 lists a number of
interesting possibilities. They are divided into <i>mathematical</i>
functions
which should be independent of the machine or programming
language

which are dependent on the

nonlinear <i>operators</i>
which are supported
by nearly all versions of BASIC

This final chapter will describe some of the scientific applications

<b>8.1  How Common is Chaos?</b>
</p><p>
For hundreds of years
scientists in many disciplines have used
equations like those in the previous chapters to describe nature.
It is remarkable that almost no one recognized the chaotic solutions
to those equations until the last few decades of the twentieth
century. Now people are beginning to see chaos under every rock.
It is reasonable to wonder whether chaos is the rule or the exception.
</p><p>
Suppose we had a system of equations of sufficient complexity
and with sufficiently many coefficients that it could be used
to model most natural processes. We could then attempt to quantify
the occurrence of chaos in these equations and draw an inference
about the occurrence of chaos in nature. The equations in the
previous chapters
especially those involving polynomials of high
dimension and high order
might approximate such a system.
</p><p>
As a simple but very unrealistic example
suppose that all of
nature could be modeled by the logistic equation (Equation 1C).
This equation has a single parameter <i>R</i> that controls the
character of the solution. If <i>R</i> is greater than 4 or less
than -2
the solutions are unbounded
which means that this equation
cannot model a physical process under those conditions. Essentially
all physical processes are bounded
except perhaps the trajectory
of a spacecraft launched with sufficient velocity to escape the
galaxy. In the physically realistic range of <i>R</i>
there is
a band of chaos between about 3.5 and 4 as shown in Figure 1-2
and another identical band between -2 and about -1.5. Careful
analysis shows that chaos occurs over about 13% of the range of
<i>R</i> from -2 to 4.
</p><p>
Since the logistic equation is too simple a model for almost
everything
we should examine more complicated models. The Hénon
map (Equations 3A) is a two-dimensional generalization of the
logistic map. It has two control parameters
which are normally
taken as <i>a</i> = -1.4 and <i>b</i> = 0.3. With <i>b</i> = 0

the Hénon map reduces to the logistic map.
</p><p>
As with the logistic map
the Hénon map has unbounded
solutions
chaotic solutions
and bounded non-chaotic solutions
depending on the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The bounded
non-chaotic solutions may be either fixed points or  periodic
limit cycles. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-01.gif">Figure 8-1</a> shows a region of the <i>ab</i>-plane
with the four classes of solutions indicated by different shades
of gray. The bounded solutions constitute an island in the <i>ab</i>-plane.
On the northwest shore of this island is a chaotic beach
which
occupies about 6% of the area of the island. The chaotic beach
has many small embedded periodic ponds. The boundary between the
chaotic and the periodic regions is itself a fractal.</p><hr>

<b><a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-01.gif">Figure 8-1</a>. Regions of Solutions for the Hénon Map in
the <i>ab</i>-Plane</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>The logistic map is chaotic over 13% of its bounded range

and the Hénon map is chaotic over 6% of its bounded range.
This result is counter-intuitive since it suggests that more complicated
(2-D) systems are in some sense less chaotic than simpler (1-D)
systems. Is this a general result
or is it peculiar to these
two maps? One way to decide is to examine a wider selection of
equations such as the ones used to produce the attractors exhibited
throughout this book.
</p><p>
In collecting attractors
we have been discarding interesting
information--the number of bounded non-chaotic solutions for each
chaotic case that the program finds. Discarding data is offensive
to scientists
since experiments are often performed with great
effort and at considerable expense. The annals of science are
ripe with examples of important discoveries that could have been
made sooner or by others if only the right data had been recorded
and analyzed.
</p><p>
Table 8.1 shows the results from 30
000 chaotic cases (1000 for
each of the 30 types) as identified by the program. This table
required examining over 400 million cases of which about one million
were bounded. Of all the bounded solutions
2.8% were chaotic
according to the criterion described in Section 2.4. The polynomial
maps all exhibit a similar occurrence of chaotic solutions. The
same is true of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
but the
percentage is smaller. The reason for this behavior is not understood.

<b> </b>These results should not be taken too seriously because
the coefficients have been limited to the range -1.2 to 1.2
the
ODEs have not been solved very accurately
and there are many
ambiguous cases. There is a tendency for the chaotic solutions
to occur at large values of the coefficients where most of the
solutions are unbounded. A more careful evaluation
correcting
these difficulties and including about 35
000 strange attractors

but limited to fewer types
shows that the probability that a
bounded solution is chaotic for an iterated polynomial map of
dimension <i>D</i> and order <i>O</i> is given approximately by
</p><p>
<i>P</i> = 0.349 <i>D</i>-1.69 <i>O</i>-0.28          (Eq. 8A)
</p><p>
Similarly
the probability that a bounded solution is chaotic
for a polynomial ODE of dimension <i>D</i> and order <i>O</i>
is given approximately by
</p><p>
<i>P</i> = 0.0003 <i>D</i>2 <i>O</i>0.5          (Eq. 8B)
</p><p>
Maps appear to become less chaotic as they become more complicated
(larger <i>D</i> and <i>O</i>)
whereas ODEs become more chaotic.
</p><p>
To assess how common chaos is in nature
we would need to address
the more complicated and subjective issue of whether the equations
we have examined are a representative sample of the equations
that describe natural processes. Furthermore
there is no reason
to assume <i>a priori</i> that nature selects the coefficients
of the equations uniformly over the bounded region of control
space. It is possible that other constraints mitigate either against
or in favor of chaotic behavior.
</p><p>
Another interesting question is how the fractal dimension and
the Lyapunov exponent vary with the dimension and order of the
system. Table 8.1 includes the average values of these quantities
plus or minus (±) the standard deviation for each type of
chaotic system. For polynomial maps and ODEs
the fractal dimension
varies approximately as the square root of the embedding dimension.
For polynomial maps
the Lyapunov exponent varies inversely with
the embedding dimension. For polynomial ODEs
the Lyapunov exponent
increases with embedding dimension. The Lyapunov exponent appears
to be independent of order for maps
but there is a tendency for
the Lyapunov exponent of ODEs to increase with order.
</p><p>
These results are summarized in Figures 8-2 and 8-3. Figure 8-2
shows the relative probability that a strange attractor from a
polynomial map or ODE will have a fractal dimension <i>F</i> plotted
versus <i>F</i>/<i>D</i>0.5. The curve is sharply peaked at a
value of about 0.8. There are almost no attractors with fractal
dimension greater than about 1.2<i>D</i>0.5. The Lorenz and Rössler
Attractors (with fractal dimensions slightly above 2.0 in a three-dimensional
space) are close to this maximum value. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-03.gif">Figure 8-3</a> shows the relative
probability that a strange attractor from a polynomial map will
have a Lyapunov exponent <i>L</i> plotted versus <i>LD</i>. This
curve shows a much broader peak at about 0.5. The reason for this
behavior is not understood.</p><hr>

</p><p>
<b> </b>The similarity of the fractal dimension for attractors
produced by polynomials of the same dimensionality raises the
concern that they might in some sense all be the same attractor

viewed from different angles and distorted in various ways. There
may be a simple mapping that converts one attractor into the others.
In such a case
a statistical analysis of the collection would
be misleading and meaningless. However
since the Lyapunov exponents
are spread over a broad range
it seems likely that the attractors
are distinct. In any case
they are visually very different
and
thus the technique has artistic if not scientific value.
</p><p>
It is interesting to ask whether the above results are peculiar
to polynomials. Table 8.1 includes data for the special functions
that were described in Chapter 7. Some of these cases tend to
be more chaotic than the polynomials
but the differences are
not enormous. Thus is would appear
insofar as nature can be represented
by systems of equations of the type described in this book
that
chaos is not the most common behavior
but neither is it particularly
rare.
</p><p>
<b>8.2  But is it Art?</b>
</p><p>
A very different question is whether pictures generated by solving
deterministic equations with a computer can legitimately qualify
as art. Some people would say that if it was done by a computer
without human intervention
it cannot be art. On the other hand

humans chose the equations
built and programmed the computer

decided how the solution would be displayed
and selected from
the large number of cases that the computer generated. In this
view
the computer is just another tool in the hands of the artist.
</p><p>
At the core of the issue is what we mean by <i>art</i>. There
are at least two
not necessarily mutually incompatible
views.
One is that art is the expression of ideas and emotions--a form
of communication between the artist and the observer. The other
emphasizes formal design
in which the viewer admires the skill
with which the artist manipulated the materials
without reading
any particular meaning into it.
</p><p>
Strange attractors qualify by either definition. They are expressions
of ideas embodied in the equations
whether it be the dynamics
of population growth or a swinging pendulum. These ideas are often
abstract and are most apparent to the trained mathematician or
scientist
but anyone can see in the patterns the surreal images
of plants
animals
clouds
and swirling fluids. The appearance
of such images in the solutions of mathematical equations is probably
more than coincidental.
</p><p>
Strange attractors also necessarily embody concepts of design.
The interplay of determinism and unpredictability ensures that
they are neither formless nor excessively repetitious. Furthermore

the skills of an artisan (if not an artist) are required to translate
the abstract equations into aesthetically desirable visual forms.
These skills are different from (but not inferior to) those possessed
by more conventional artists. Renaissance artists
such as Leonardo
da Vinci
were often also scientists. We may now be entering a
new Renaissance in which art and science are again being drawn
together through the visual images produced by computers.
</p><p>
Some artists view art as a creative process whose primary goal
is to provide the artist with a sense of satisfaction. The resulting
work is merely an inevitable by-product. This view seems especially
appropriate for the production of strange attractors
where the
programmer's satisfaction is derived from causing the computer
to generate the patterns
even if they are never seen by anyone
else. Indeed
the computer offers the ideal medium for such conceptual
artists
since there need be no material product whatsoever.
</p><p>
Note that visual art does not need to be beautiful to be good

just as a play need not be humorous. It may be intellectually
or emotionally satisfying
or even disturbing. It should capture
and hold the interest of the viewer
however. The span of the
viewer's attention is one measure of its quality. Art may mix
the familiar and the unfamiliar to produce both comfort and dissonance.
Furthermore
beauty is at least partially in the eye of the beholder

although recent research indicates that there are absolute universal
measures of beauty that form very early in life
and that may
even be genetic.
</p><p>
<b>8.3  Can Computers Critique Art?</b>
</p><p>
The idea that a computer can make aesthetic judgments seems absurd
and even offensive to many people. Yet the program developed in
this book is already doing this to some degree. For every object
(strange attractor) that it identifies
it has discarded many
dozens as being uninteresting (non-chaotic). Perhaps the computer
could be programmed to be even more discriminating and to select
those strange attractors that are likely to appeal to humans.
To the extent that aesthetic judgment involves objective as well
as subjective criteria
such a proposition is not unreasonable.
</p><p>
A computer lacks emotion
but it can be taught in much the same
way that people can be taught. With the help of a human to point
out which attractors are visually interesting
the computer can
correlate human opinion with various quantitative measures of
the attractor. It can then test each new case and assign a probability
that it would appeal to a human.
</p><p>
One of the reasons we have been calculating and saving the fractal
dimension and Lyapunov exponent for each strange attractor is
in anticipation of developing such criteria. You can think of
the dimension as a measure of the <i>strangeness</i> of an attractor
and the Lyapunov exponent as a measure of its <i>chaoticity</i>.
These are just two of infinitely many independent quantities that
we could use to describe each attractor. If we find encouragement
from them
it suggests that more could be done.
</p><p>
The first step is to search for a relation between the aesthetic
quality and the fractal dimension or Lyapunov exponent. For this
purpose
7500 strange attractors from two-dimensional quadratic
maps were evaluated by the author and seven volunteers
including
two graduate art students
a former art history major
three physics
graduate students
and a former mathematics major. All evaluators
were born and raised in the United States. The evaluations were
done by choosing attractors randomly and displaying them sequentially
on the computer screen without any indication of the quantities
that characterize them. The volunteers were asked to evaluate
each case on a scale of one to five according to its aesthetic
appeal. It only took a few seconds for each evaluation.
</p><p>
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-04.gif">Figure 8-4</a> displays a summary of all the evaluations as a function
of fractal dimension (<i>F</i>) and Lyapunov exponent (<i>L</i>)
using a gray scale in which the darker regions are the most highly
rated. The cases examined by particular individuals show a similar
trend. All evaluators tended to prefer attractors with dimensions
between about 1.1 and 1.5 and Lyapunov exponents between zero
and about 0.3. Some of the most interesting cases have Lyapunov
exponents below about 0.1. You will find many such examples earlier
in this book.</p><hr>

</p><p>
The dimension preference is not surprising
since many natural
objects have dimensions in this range. Nature is strange
but
usually not totally bizarre. Some of the attractors that are most
universally liked resemble well-known and easily recognizable
objects. You will find many such examples in this book.
</p><p>
The Lyapunov exponent preference is harder to understand
but
it suggests that strongly chaotic systems are too unpredictable
to be appealing. For the 443 cases that were rated five (best)
by the evaluators
the average dimension was <i>F</i> = 1.30 ±
0.20
and the average Lyapunov exponent was <i>L</i> = 0.21 ±
0.13 bits per iterations
where the errors represent plus or minus
one standard deviation. About 28% of the cases evaluated fall
within both error bars. Thus this simple criterion would allow
the computer to discard nearly three-quarters of the cases that
are least likely to be visually appealing. This technique works
in practice and was used in some cases to help select attractors
to display in this book.
</p><p>
<b>8.4  What's Left to Do?</b>
</p><p>
This book has described a new technique for generating strange
attractors in unlimited numbers. A large collection of such objects
offers many interesting possibilities to the artist and scientist
alike. Some of these uses have been mentioned previously. Others
may already have occurred to you. This section will leave you
with a few additional suggestions of things you might want to
explore on your own.
</p><p>
If your main interest is art
you probably would like to produce
attractors with improved spatial resolution and with more colors.
You can experiment with printing on different types of paper or
other media. The simple linear correspondence of <i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>

<i>Z</i>
and <i>W</i> to position or color is not essential.
Other mappings between the mathematical variables and the points
displayed on the screen are possible. You have already seen how
to project the attractors onto a sphere. You can project them
onto other objects such as cylinders
tori
or even other strange
attractors.
</p><p>
When you have generated an attractor that appeals to you
it
is natural to want to make small changes to make it even better.
The coefficients in the equations are controls that you can adjust.
Like knobs on your television set
they allow you to tune the
attractor to get just what you want. Similarly
you will want
more control over the colors
which is possible with the PALETTE
command in BASIC. You may also want to rotate the image to find
the best angle from which to view it.
</p><p>
You can produce animated strange attractors with a video camera
viewing a monitor connected to the camera
or even more simply

with a photo-diode connected to an oscilloscope whose screen illuminates
the photo-diode. This <i>video-feedback</i> technique has much
in common with iterated maps. Each illuminated dot on the screen
is mapped back to a different location after a delay determined
by the propagation of the electrical and optical signals. The
main control parameters are the distance
rotation
focusing

intensity
color
and hue. Some settings produce unbounded solutions--the
screen goes solid black or solid white. Other settings produce
a fixed-point solution with a stationary pattern. Under other
conditions
periodic behavior occurs. The most interesting situation
is when the pattern constantly changes but is not periodic
corresponding
to a chaotic strange attractor. Sometimes you can perturb the
system with a flash of light or by moving your hand across the
field of view and cause the system to switch from one attractor
to another.
</p><p>
Some of the most interesting examples of computer fractals come
from plotting the basin boundaries of various attractors. The
basin is the set of all initial conditions that are drawn to the
attractor. Sometimes these boundaries are smooth; other times
they are fractals. By coloring the points just outside the basin
according to the number of iterations required for them to leave
some (usually large) region surrounding the attractor
beautiful
escape-time fractal patterns can be produced.
</p><p>
All of our attractors have such basins
and it's not hard to
program the computer to display them
but the calculations are
very slow. As an example
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-05.gif">Figure 8-5</a> shows in black the basin
for the Hénon map. It is relatively smooth and not particularly
interesting. It resembles a thick version of the attractor
but
rotated by 90 degrees. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-06.gif">Figure 8-6</a> shows the basin of another two-dimensional
quadratic map called the <i>Tinkerbell map</i>. Its boundary has
obvious fractal structure. In each case
the basin boundary appears
to touch the attractor
suggesting that this surprising feature
may be common.</p><hr>

<b> </b>Notice that we have now plotted the Hénon map in
three different spaces. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig3-01.gif">Figure 3-1</a> is the usual plot in the space
of the dynamical variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. <a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-01.gif">Figure 8-1</a> is
a plot in the space of the control parameters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals/bookfigs/fig8-05.gif">Figure 8-5</a> is a plot in the space of the initial conditions <i>X</i>0
and <i>Y</i>0. All of these plots are necessary to characterize
the attractor completely.
</p><p>
The well-known and much-studied Mandelbrot set is the set of
bounded solutions in the <i>ab</i>-plane of the mapping
</p><p>
<i>Xn</i>+1 = <i>Xn2</i> - <i>Yn2</i> + <i>a</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 8C)
</p><p>
<i>Yn</i>+1 = 2<i>XnYn</i> + <i>b</i>
</p><p>
The variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are usually thought of as
the real and imaginary parts of a complex number <i>Z</i>. Each
point in the <i>ab</i>-plane has associated with it a <i>Julia
set</i>
which is the set of all initial conditions <i>X</i>0
and <i>Y</i>0 whose solutions are bounded. The Julia set is named
after Gaston Julia
a French mathematician
who along with Pierre
Fatou studied iterated maps in the complex plane at about the
time of the first world war. Combinations of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set produce chaotic solutions

but values inside the set lead to fixed points or limit cycles.
For <i>b</i> = 0 and <i>Y</i>0 = 0 (the real axis)
Equations
8C reduce to a simple one-dimensional quadratic map equivalent
to the logistic map.
</p><p>
The Mandelbrot set has been described as the most complicated
mathematical object ever seen. It may also be the ultimate computer
virus
in that it takes over not only the machine (because of
the large computational requirements)
but the mind of the programmer

who often becomes addicted to the beauty and variety of the patterns
that it produces.
</p><p>
Like the Mandelbrot set
most of the attractors produced by the
programs in this book have intricate structure near the basin
boundaries. You can zoom in on these regions to produce patterns
that rival those produced by the Mandelbrot set. Calculation times
increase markedly as you zoom in ever more closely
however.
</p><p>
Much more could be done to correlate the aesthetic appeal of
the attractors with the various numerical quantities that characterize
them. Besides the fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent
there
is the dimension and order of the system that produced them. There
are other measures of an attractor's dimension
such as the <i>capacity</i>
dimension
the <i>information</i> dimension
and the <i>Lyapunov</i>
dimension. Related to the Lyapunov exponent is the <i>entropy</i>

which is a measure of the disorder of the system. As with the
dimension
there are many ways to define the entropy. These quantities
and others are described in many of the books on fractals in the
bibliography. Maps and differential equations could also be compared.
</p><p>
You could test for differences between the aesthetic preferences
of artists and scientists. Preliminary indications suggest that
complexity might appeal more to artists than to scientists
who
tend to see beauty in simplicity. There may also be discernible
cultural differences. You could see how the various display techniques
alter one's preferences. For example
the use of color seems to
increase the tolerance for attractors of high fractal dimension.
</p><p>
There are many scientific studies that could be performed on
a sufficiently large collection of strange attractors. The results
of Table 8.1
which are merely suggestive and limited to particular
types of equations
could be refined with more cases and more
examples of each case. For low dimensions
maps are more chaotic
than the equivalent ODEs. As the embedding dimension increases

however
maps become less chaotic
while ODEs become more chaotic.
Equations 8A and 8B suggest that for an embedding dimension of
about six
maps and ODEs will be equally chaotic. Will their roles
reverse at higher dimension
or will the chaotic fractions asymptotically
approach a universal value of about two percent?
</p><p>
The same type of questions could be asked about bounded
non-chaotic
solutions (fixed points
limit cycles
and tori). It is especially
interesting to see how common 3-tori are in light of Peixoto's
theorem (see Section 6.6)
but their production probably requires
embedding dimensions of about 10 according to Figure 8-2
which
may or may not apply to tori. Almost nothing is known about such
issues.
</p><p>
We have considered the <i>fraction</i> of the bounded
hyper-dimensional
control space over which chaos occurs. It is also interesting
to examine the shape
location
and dimension of this chaotic
region
as we did for the two-parameter Hénon map in Figure
8-1. It is likely that this region is a fractal. How does its
fractal dimension depend on the embedding dimension and other
characteristics of the system of equations? It appears that the
dimension of the chaotic region is about half the dimension of
the control space for the cases in this book.
</p><p>
The scaling of average fractal dimension and Lyapunov exponent
with embedding dimension is intriguing and should be studied with
more cases
better statistics
and more accurate calculations
of the fractal dimension. You could examine statistically how
the various measures of dimension compare and how these dimensions
are related to the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents.
</p><p>
You could look for relations between the geometrical properties
of attractors and their respective power spectra. The technique
could be used to explore and to quantify the various routes by
which a stable solution becomes chaotic. Many such routes have
been identified
such as the period-doubling exhibited by the
logistic equation
but there are probably others yet to be discovered.
Your role resembles that of a biologist confronted with a large
variety of species
trying to classify
quantify
and study their
similarities
differences
and patterns of behavior.
</p><p>
Another interesting study is to search for previously unknown
simple examples of chaos. Variations of the logistic equation
are the simplest chaotic polynomial maps. The Lorenz and Rössler
attractors are often cited as the simplest examples of chaotic
polynomial ODEs. The Lorenz equations (Eq. 6D) have seven terms
and two quadratic nonlinearities
and the Rössler equations
(Eq. 6E) have seven terms and one quadratic nonlinearity.
</p><p>
There are at least five different systems of chaotic three-dimensional
quadratic ODEs with five terms and two nonlinearities and five
systems with six terms and one nonlinearity. It will be left as
a challenge for you to find them. There does not seem to be any
chaotic system of polynomial ODEs with as few as four terms. To
whet your appetite
here's a simple system resembling the Lorenz
attractor that has two fewer terms and all its coefficients equal
to one:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>YZ</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 8D)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = <i>X</i> - <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = 1 - <i>XY</i>
</p><p>
You can examine this case using the code QM7NM3NM3LM4NM2LM6. 
Here's another case with five terms and all unity coefficients
that's volume-preserving and thus does not have an attractor

but its solution is either a two-torus or chaotic depending on
the initial conditions:
</p><p>
<i>X'</i> = <i>Y</i>
</p><p>
(Eq. 8E)
</p><p>
<i>Y'</i> = -<i>X</i> + <i>YZ</i>
</p><p>
<i>Z'</i> = 1 - <i>Y</i>2
</p><p>
It can be produced with the code QM5NM5LM5NM2NM5LM3.
</p><p>
<b>8.5  What Good is it?</b>
</p><p>
It is rare that a mathematical concept captivates the interest
not only of scientists in diverse fields but of the general public.
Chaos has done this
and it has been heralded by some as the next
great revolution in science. It has ushered in a new field of
<i>experimental mathematics</i>
sometimes called <i>recreational
mathematics</i> by the more traditional and often cynical older
breed of mathematicians. The use of computers to produce exotic
visual patterns has made difficult mathematical ideas accessible
to those without extensive formal training.
</p><p>
Yet it is fair to ask what it has done other than to make pretty
pictures. One response is to claim that the same things were probably
said about the discovery of the atomic nucleus--or electricity--or
fire. We must have faith that intellectual advances will eventually
yield useful applications.
</p><p>
At the deepest level
an understanding of chaos alters our view
of the world. Having seen the complexity that can arise from simple
equations
we have reason to hope that simple equations may suffice
to describe much of the complexity of the world. Difficult and
long-standing problems such as fluid turbulence may eventually
be understood using the ideas of chaos. Turbulence is difficult
because it involves both temporal and spatial chaos and because
its dimension is high. Chaos may also provide tools for making
better predictions of complicated and apparently random systems
such as the weather
the stock market
earthquakes
epidemics

and population growth. It may also have applications in cryptography
for devising codes that are difficult to break and for breaking
existing codes.
</p><p>
Since chaotic systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial
conditions
you might conclude that prediction is hopeless
but
this is not the case. Prediction is hopeless for a random system
or for an extremely complicated deterministic system. As the physicist
Neils Bohr remarked
"Prediction is difficult
especially
of the future."  However
if the system is simple and chaotic

then the determinism can be exploited to improve short-term predictions.
</p><p>
Furthermore
if the equations produce a strange attractor
as
most chaotic systems do
we know that the solution will lie somewhere
on the attractor. Remember that an attractor occupies a negligible
volume of the space in which it is embedded. Although we can't
predict where on the attractor the system will be at any particular
time in the distant future
we can exclude the vast number of
possible states that lie off the attractor. In meteorological
terms
this might lead to eliminating the possibility of certain
weather conditions with near absolute certainty.
</p><p>
When we see a system in nature that behaves erratically
we are
now led to wonder whether it is an example of chaos. Is determinism
hidden in seemingly random data? This problem is opposite to the
one addressed in this book. Here we have started with simple equations
and produced complicated patterns. Nature presents us with complicated
patterns that may or may not come from simple equations.
</p><p>
Often we are given only a single fluctuating quantity sampled
at discrete times--a so-called <i>time series</i>. The average
daily temperature in New York and the daily closing Dow Jones
Industrial Average are two examples of a time series. Sometimes
a complicated-looking time series is simply a sum of several sine
waves of different unrelated frequencies. In such a case accurate
predictions are possible using linear methods. A good example
is the tides
whose behavior is not simply periodic
but which
nevertheless can be predicted with considerable accuracy. More
often
the time series has no such simple representation. In such
a case we would like to determine whether the behavior is random
or chaotic. Chaotic systems often produce strange attractors.
</p><p>
We usually don't have data for all the variables that describe
the system
nor do we even know how many there are
and so we
don't know the dimension of the space in which an attractor might
be embedded. Furthermore
the data record is likely to be corrupted
by random noise and measurement errors. The number of data points
may be small
and the system may not have reached a steady-state.
Finally
we usually don't have control over the system
and so
we cannot directly test its sensitivity to initial conditions.
</p><p>
Such a situation sounds hopeless
but progress has recently been
made in detecting chaos in natural systems. For example
one can
plot each data point versus its predecessor
as we did with the
one-dimensional maps in Chapter 2. In some cases this procedure
is enough to reveal the determinism. More often
it is necessary
to plot each data point versus several of its predecessors in
a high-dimensional space. If the system is described by a strange
attractor
the result will be a distorted version of the attractor

but with the same fractal dimension. Similarly
the Lyapunov exponent
can be estimated by selecting nearby points in this space and
determining how rapidly they diverge from one another.
</p><p>
The fractal dimension is important because the number of variables
and equations is at least as large as the next higher integer

since the attractor has to be embedded in a space with dimension
higher than its fractal dimension. These equations are not unique

however. Extracting equations from the data is a difficult if
not impossible task
but one whose rewards justify the effort.
</p><p>
Dynamical systems are everywhere. Your body contains several.
Your heart is a dynamical system whose solution normally approaches
a limit cycle
but which can become chaotic when in fibrillation

or a fixed point upon death. Recent research suggests that even
a healthy heart beats chaotically
and that a nearly periodic
pattern sometimes precedes cardiac arrest.
</p><p>
Other oscillations occur in your lungs
brain
and muscles. Electrocardiograms
and electroencephalograms are time-series records used by doctors
to deduce information about the dynamics of the corresponding
organ. Some chaos in the brain may be necessary for creativity

in that it prevents us from repeatedly approaching the same problems
in the same way. The fractal dimension of electroencephalograms
has been observed to increase when a subject is engaged in mental
activity. In psychology
manic depression resembles a limit cycle

and certain types of erratic behavior might be strange attractors.
</p><p>
Evidence for low-dimensional strange attractors has been found
in systems as diverse as the weather and climate
the business
cycle
childhood epidemics
sunspots
plasma fluctuations
and
even in computer models of the arms race. Some of these results
should be viewed skeptically because there are many ways to be
misled. One needs the order of 10<i>D</i> data points
where <i>D</i>
is the embedding dimension
although the exact requirements are
unknown. If the interval between data points is too small
a fictitiously
low dimension can result. Certain types of <i>colored noise</i>
(also called <i>fractional Brownian motion</i>) have a degree
of determinism and produce time-series records with an apparently
low dimension. Many tests have been devised
such as comparing
the results with those from a surrogate data set obtained by randomly
shuffling the numbers in the time series.
</p><p>
Chaos has a deep philosophical significance. If determinism implied
perfect predictability
there would be no room for free will.
We would be just small cogs in a large machine over which we have
no control. It's easy to feel insignificant in a vast and complicated
universe dominated by forces too powerful to resist.
</p><p>
However
chaos illustrates that determinism does <i>not</i> imply
predictability. What is bad news for those who want to predict
the weather or the stock market
is good news for those who want
to control them. Recall the hypothetical butterfly flapping its
wings in Brazil
which sets off tornadoes in Texas. If the world
is really governed by deterministic chaos
we are drastically
changing the future with everything we do. We need never feel
unimportant or insignificant. Who would have thought that a concept
from mathematics could give meaning and purpose to our lives?

<b>APPENDIX B</b>
</p><p>
<b>BASIC Program Listing</b>
</p><p>
This appendix contains the complete BASIC program that you should
have developed if you followed the exercises in this book
along
with a few additions. It should run without modification on DOS-based
IBM personal computers or compatibles under Microsoft BASICA

GW-BASIC
QBASIC
QuickBASIC
or VisualBASIC for MS-DOS; Borland
International TurboBASIC; and Spectra Publishing PowerBASIC. A
disk containing the source program and a version of the program
complied with PowerBASIC (<b>SA.EXE</b>) and ready to run is included
with the book. This is a relatively no-frills program
in that
it lacks extensive error trapping
fancy menus
and mouse support

but it is fully functional and relatively robust.
</p><p>
The additions to the program are as follows:
</p><p>
1. The program contains a version number (2.0) and a copyright
notice. Your purchase of this book and the accompanying disk entitles
you to personal use of the program. It is not legal for you to
make a copy of the program for someone else
to place it in the
public domain
or to incorporate it in whole or in part into programs
that are distributed to others. The idea of programming a computer
to search automatically for strange attractors based on calculation
of the Lyapunov exponent is believed to be original
and proper
scientific etiquette requires that you acknowledge the author
in any further dissemination of work based on this technique.
</p><p>
2. The program includes a somewhat inelegant but effective test
for the graphics capability of the computer on which it is used.
It causes the program to run automatically in the highest graphics
mode that is supported by the hardware and by the BASIC version
under which it is compiled or run. The program prints a message
and stops if the computer does not have a graphics monitor. Colors
are adjusted for CGA MODE 1
and text is properly formatted for
screens with 40 columns of text.
</p><p>
3. The program allows you to change the number of iterations
that are plotted while in the search mode using the <b>N</b> key.
Values of a thousand (10^3) to a billion (10^9) are allowed. Note
that this value excludes the thousand iterations that are always
performed to allow the initial transient to decay.
</p><p>
4. In addition to the planar and spherical projections
the <b>P</b>
command allows you to project the attractors onto a cylinder with
a horizontal or vertical axis
or a torus. The toroidal projection
is shown looking along the major axis with the doughnut hole at
the center of the screen and of negligible size.
</p><p>
5. A <b>C</b> command has been added to allow you to clear the
screen and restart the calculation with the current values of
the variables. This feature allows you to remove the transient
in cases where the orbit requires more than a thousand iterations
to reach the attractor or to reduce the density of points on the
screen
which is sometimes useful
for example
with the 3-D anaglyphic
displays.
</p><p>
6. The program allows you to press <b>V</b> to save a record
of up to 16
000 consecutive iterates of <i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
<i>Z</i>

or <i>W</i> in a disk file that can be analyzed in more detail
by other programs. To conserve disk space
each new attractor
overwrites the data from the previous case. The data files can
be read by the companion program <i>Chaos Data Analyzer</i>
which
allows the data to be displayed in many ways including phase-space
plots
return maps
and Poincaré movies; calculates probability
distributions
power spectra
Lyapunov exponents
correlation
functions
and capacity and correlation dimensions; and makes
predictions based on a novel technique involving singular value
decomposition. <i>Chaos Data Analyzer</i> is available from The

<b>Other Computers and BASIC Versions</b>
</p><p>
<b> </b>Here are some considerations for using the programs with
non-IBM-compatible computers and with different dialects of BASIC.
</p><p>
<b>BASICA and GW-BASIC</b>
</p><p>
These old versions of BASIC are mostly compatible with the program
listings in this book. They do not support VGA graphics
and the
older versions don't even support EGA. Thus you may have to change
SM<i>%</i> = 12 in line 1030 to a lower number. The listing <b>PROG28.BAS</b>
automatically selects an appropriate graphics mode.
</p><p>
These versions of BASIC do not support strings longer than 255
characters. The easiest way to circumvent this problem is to limit
the four-dimensional searches to cubic polynomials. Adding the
following line to the program after line 2680 will accomplish
this:
</p><p>
2685    IF <i>M%</i> &gt; 253 THEN GOTO 2650
</p><p>
<b>TurboBASIC and PowerBASIC</b>
</p><p>
The program listings in this book are compatible with TurboBASIC
and PowerBASIC except for a quirk with the CIRCLE command with
VGA graphics that requires the following change in line 3320:
</p><p>
3320 IF <i>PJT</i>% = 1 AND <i>TRD</i>% &lt; 5 THEN IF <i>SM</i>%
&lt; 11 THEN CIRCLE (<i>XA</i>
<i>YA</i>)
.36 * (<i>XH</i> -
<i>XL</i>) ELSE CIRCLE (<i>XA</i>
<i>YA</i>)
.5 * (<i>YH</i>
- <i>YL</i>)
</p><p>
<b>VisualBASIC for MS-DOS</b>
</p><p>
The programs as listed will compile and run directly under VisualBASIC
for MS-DOS. This version of BASIC makes it easy for you to add
pull-down menus
dialog boxes
and mouse support to give the user
interface a more modern look and feel.
</p><p>
<b>VisualBASIC for Windows</b>
</p><p>
One way to convert the programs to run as Microsoft Windows applications
is to use the utility <b>TRNSLATE.EXE</b> supplied with VisualBASIC
for MS-DOS to translate the programs into VisualBASIC for Windows.
There are many program differences that will have to be resolved

however.
</p><p>
A VisualBASIC for Windows version of the listing <b>PROG06</b>
but without the keyboard strobe and sound capabilities is given
in the listing <b>PROG06VB.BAS</b>. VisualBASIC for Windows 2.0
does not support the SOUND statement or INKEY$ function
although
these capabilities and many others are available through internal
Windows drivers. You can use this listing as a starting point
for converting the other programs in this book for use with Microsoft
Windows. The accompanying disk contains a compiled version of
this program in the file <b>SAWIN.EXE</b>. To run this program

the <b>VBRUN200.DLL</b> run-time dynamic link library that comes
with VisualBASIC version 2.00 must be in a directory in your search
path.

<b>QuickBASIC for Apple Macintosh Systems</b>
</p><p>
If you want to run the programs on an Apple Macintosh
the easiest
way is to use the Macintosh version of QuickBASIC. Unfortunately

this BASIC (at least in version 1.0) is not very compatible with
any of the IBM BASICs
and it lacks many important and useful
commands
although most of the missing features (such as color)
are available through BASIC calls to the Macintosh Toolbox. An
alternate though probably equally difficult  approach is to convert
the C source listing in Appendix D for use with one of the C compilers
available for the Macintosh.
</p><p>
The QuickBASIC for Macintosh version of the programs typically
executes more slowly than those compiled with the IBM version
of QuickBASIC. For example
the program used to produce the data
in Table 2.2 finds about 106 attractors per hour when compiled
with the Macintosh version of QuickBASIC and run on a 25 MHz Macintosh
IIci with a floating-point coprocessor and only 14 per hour when
using the QuickBASIC interpreter on the same computer.
</p><p>
To get you started
the listing <b>PROG06QB.MAC</b> is a QuickBASIC
for Macintosh version of <b>PROG06</b>. You can use it as a starting
point for converting the other programs in this book for use on
the Macintosh. You can use the Apple File Exchange utility to
transfer <b>PROG06QB.MAC</b> on the accompanying disk to a Macintosh
with a high density (1.4 MB) disk drive.

<b>C Program Listing</b>
</p><p>
This appendix contains a translation of the BASIC program <b>PROG28.BAS</b>
in Appendix B into the C language. The C language is preferred
by many programmers because of its efficiency
economy
and portability.
However
the language is relatively sparse and relies on machine-specific

run-time libraries for most input and output. Although there is
a C standard (ANSI C)
many necessary extensions are incorporated
into various C compilers. These extensions also differ from one
platform to another.

The listing here should compile and run without modification
under Microsoft QuickC version 2.5 on the IBM PC-compatible platform.
Some changes will be required to run under other versions of C.
The disk included with this book contains the Microsoft QuickC
source listing in a file <b>PROG28QC.C</b> and a version <b>PROG28TC.CPP</b>
that should compile and run with Borland TurboC++ version 3.0.
The programs will compile using the small memory model with either
compiler. However
you will probably find that the C versions
run at about the same speed as the Microsoft QuickBASIC or VisualBASIC
for MS-DOS version.
</p><p>
The C versions of the program are fairly literal translations
of the BASIC version. All variables are global and retain the
same names as in the BASIC version. The BASIC subroutines have
been converted into C functions whose names correspond to the
BASIC line numbers. No variables are passed to or from any of
the functions. The level of indentation is minimal. The program
assumes the computer has VGA color graphics. The listing <b>PROG28QC.C</b>
should compile to a fully functional program except for the fact
that QuickC lacks a sound function.

<b>APPENDIX E</b>
</p><p>
<b>Summary of Equations</b>
</p><p>
This appendix contains a complete list
in all its gory detail

of the equations solved by the program to produce the attractors
in this book. For simplicity
the subscripts <i>n</i>+1 and <i>n</i>
have been omitted on the variables <i>X</i>
<i>Y</i>
<i>Z</i>

and <i>W</i>. If it serves no other purpose
this appendix vividly
illustrates the power of programming languages in expressing and
evaluating lengthy formulas! It is worth emphasizing that the
attractors that come from simple equations are every bit as interesting
and beautiful as those that come from complicated equations.

<b>APPENDIX F</b>
</p><p>
<b>Dictionaries of Strange Attractors</b>
</p><p>
Included in this appendix are alphabetical listings of the codes
for those attractors shown in this book whose figures lack the
full codes
a selection of additional interesting cases
and a
list of special cases of historical or mathematical significance.
The numbers at the end of each code are the fractal dimension
(<i>F</i>) and the Lyapunov exponent (<i>L</i>)
respectively.
</p><p>
The cases below represent the ones shown in the book. You should
be able to identify them by the first few characters of the code.
The disk included with the book contains a file <b>BOOKFIGS.DIC</b>
with the codes for all the cases shown in the book. You can enter
these cases into the program manually using the <b>I </b>command
or copy the file <b>BOOKFIGS.DIC</b> on the accompanying disk
to <b>SA.DIC</b> and view them automatically using the <b>E</b>
command. Note that the contents of any existing <b>SA.DIC</b>
file will be lost when you do this unless you use the DOS command
<b>COPY SA.DIC + BOOKFIGS.DIC SA.DIC</b> to append the new cases
to the end of the <b>SA.DIC</b> file.

The cases below represent a collection mostly of attractors

some of which are not strange
but which are special examples
discussed in this book or other cases of historical or mathematical
significance. You can enter them into the program manually using
the <b>I </b>command or copy the file <b>SPECIAL.DIC</b> on the
accompanying disk to <b>SA.DIC</b> and view them automatically
using the <b>E</b> command. Note that the contents of any existing
<b>SA.DIC</b> file will be lost when you do this unless you use
the DOS command <b>COPY SA.DIC + SPECIAL.DIC SA.DIC</b> to append
the new cases to the end of the <b>SA.DIC</b> file.
